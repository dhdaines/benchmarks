ABSTRACT
Dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are believed to be strongl
y dark matter dominated and thus are considered perfect obje
cts to study
dark matter distribution and test theories of structure for
mation. They possess resolved, multiple stellar populatio
ns that o

er new
possibilities for modeling. A promising tool for the dynami
cal modeling of these objects is the Schwarzschild orbit sup
erposition
method. In this work we extend our previous implementation o
f the scheme toinclude more than one population of stars and a
more
general form of the mass-to-light ratio function. We tested
the improved approach on a nearly spherical, gas-free galax
y formed in
the cosmological context from the Illustris simulation. We

1. Introduction

Dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies of the Local Group (Mateo

1998; Tolstoyet al. 2009) are considered to be a perfect tool
to
test our current theories of structure formation involving
dark
matter in the context of near-eld cosmology. The objects ar

dispersion of the stars and the application of the virial the
orem.
As the samples of the stars with kinematic measurements grew
,
it became possible to estimate the prole of the velocity dis
per-
sion and model it using the Jeans equation(Binney& Tremaine

2008). Since the stars in the galaxy can move on a variety

of orbits, from circular to radial, the degeneracy between t
he
anisotropy of the orbits and the mass distribution is inhere
nt in
this type of modeling. The reason for this lies in the fact tha

It relies on building a galaxy model out of a set of best-ttin

In this paper we extend our Schwarzschild modeling tech-

try
to put tighter limits on the estimates of the mass and anisotr

In order to test our modeling method on realistic simulated

data, we decided to use a galaxy from the Illustris project

Our chosen galaxy shows a complex formation history under-

going multiple mergers which result in extended star format

with a few star formation bursts. The last wet merger, that is
a

der to dividethe stellar sample into two populationswe cut i

ssig-
nicantly. The true mass-to-light ratio prole was obtaine
d by
dividing the total mass by the tted King proles, therefore
the
drop at 100kpc is the numerical artifact occurring at the ver
y
outskirtsofthegalaxy.
Whereas in the right-handside panels of Fig.8 the resulting
anisotropy is obtained from the t of all stars and uses only t
he
locationofglobalminimumandcondencelevelsfromtwopop
-
ulations(as in the top right panel of Fig.7), in Fig.9 we pres
ent
another method of calculating the anisotropy.In the second
and
third row we show the derived proles for population I and II

separately and combine them as stellar mass weighted averag
e
in thetop row.As inpreviousgures,three columnsreferto t

di

erent lines of sight whereasthe narrowfourthone shows the
behaviorofthetrueprolesoutsidethemodeledrangewhich
,as
we noticed in our previous studies, in a limited way inuence
s
the results. Such an impact is understandable since the star
s at
larger distances from the center are still included in the li
ne-of-
sightmeasurements.
3.3. Comparison of tting results
The main strength of the two populations method comes from

tracing the underlying gravitational potential at di

erent scales.
AscanbeseeninthebottompanelsofFig.7,populationI,whi
ch
is more concentrated, is also more sensitive to

0
, but gives
weaker constraints on
a
or
c
. On the other hand, population II
attempts to reproduce the total mass content at larger dista
nces
aswell,thereforeshowingstrongercouplingbetweenthepa
ram-
eters.
The global minimums of the
Àú
2
distributions for both ap-
proaches, that is modeling one and two populations, which we

identifyasthebest-ttingmodels,closelycoincideshowi
ngthat
there is no internal bias in the improvedmethod. However, si
g-
nicant di

erences can be observed when comparing the con-
dence levels, mainly at 1 and 3
Àô
. Namely, we nd that using
two populations, the constraints we obtain on the density an
d
anisotropyprolearemuchstronger.
Additionally, the more accurate method allows us to study
other e

ects and biases, for example the consequences of the
nonsphericity of the modeled object. Whereas for the t of al
l
starsthetruevaluesofthedensity,mass,andanisotropypr
oles
are contained within 1
Àô
condence regions, the results for the
populationsaremoreorlessbiaseddependingontheaxis.Th
ey
are well reproduced for the observation along the intermedi
ate
axis, for which the e

ects of nonsphericity seem to cancel out,
and more biased for the remaining lines of sight. We notice a

trend from under- to overestimationof the anisotropy when g
o-
ingfromthemajorto theminoraxis.

4. Modeling Fornax dSph

In this section we present the application of our Schwarzsch
ild
modeling scheme to the observational data for the Fornax dSp
h
galaxy obtained by delPinoet al. (2015) and del Pinoetal.

(2017).Thisstudyisafollow-upoftheworkofKowalczyketa
l.
(2019) and can be directly compared to the results presented

there. Moreover, we refer the reader to these previous publi
ca-
tions for details on the origin of data and our procedures use
d
forcleaningthespectroscopicsample.
Similarly to the approach introduced in Section 2.2, we di-
videdallavailablestarsintotwoequal-sizepopulationsb
asedon
their metallicity and then cross-correlated the samples wi
th the
data used in Kowalczyket al. (2019). The metallicity histog
ram
of the nal spectroscopic sample is shown in Fig.10. Additio
n-
ally, we color-coded each bin with the population it has been

assigned to, namely orange or blue for population I or II. Int
er-
estingly, the case of Fornax is similar to our simulated gala
xy
as the split at [Fe
/
H]
=

1 also captures an important feature
of the object's star formation history, separating stars in
to sub-
samples older and younger than 6 Gyr, as shown in Fig. 12 of

delPinoet al. (2015) and Fig. 8 of delPinoet al. (2017). The

numbers of stars contained in the samples of all stars, popul
a-
tion I, and population II are given in Table2, where the indic
es
"phot" and "spec" refer to the photometric and kinematic sam
-
ples. The sum of stars in the populations is lower than in the
sample of all stars since only stars with reliable measureme
nts
ofmetallicitycouldbeincluded.

withrespectto theresultsofKowalczyket al.(2019).
Both constant (like for our population I) and growing (pop-
ulation II) anisotropy proles can arise from biased modeli
ng
of the real growing prole by observing an object along the

minor and major axis, respectively. However, for the bias to

occur in two populations presented here, their inner orient
a-
tions would need to be opposite. Since such morphologicalfe
a-
tures are not supported by the photometric studies of Fornax

(delPinoet al.2015;Wanget al.2019)whichratherndagood

that the anisotropy proles of the two populations modeled i

Finally, it is worth noticing that the so-called mass-follo

light model, that is the one following from the assumption th

the total density traces the stellar distribution, is no lon

ported by the t of the populations. With our parametrizatio

the mass-follows-lightmodel correspondsto

it is enclosed within 3

in Kowalczyketal. (2019), the allowed valuesfor the improv

a-
rized in Table 2 and 3 of Kowalczyket al. (2019), which were

often based on modeling subsamples of our spectroscopic dat
a
set.
For both studied objects we split the stars into two popula-
tions by dividing them in half based on their metallicity,
Z
(in
solar units), for the Illustris galaxyand [Fe
/
H] for Fornax.Such
a method is approximate but justied. Both galaxies have com

plexstarformationhistorywithmultiplestarformationbu
rsts,as
demonstrated by Fig.1 in this work and Fig. 7 in del Pinoetal.

(2013), producing multiple stellar populations which cann
ot be
easily tracked as the metallicity is a good but not perfect pr
oxy
forthestellarage.Moreover,themetallicityhistogramsf
orboth
objects are approximately unimodal not allowing for a conve
-
nient separation. More rened methods of division have been

suggestedin the literature,for examplein the formof the li
keli-
hoodfunctionbasedontheposition,velocity,andmetallic
ityin-
dex(Walker&Pe√±arrubia 2011).However,thelikelihoodfun
c-
tion requires many assumptions which introduce additional
un-
certainties into the treatmentof the data. On the other hand
,our
approach ensures the maximization of each sample (and there
-
fore minimization of sampling errors) while capturing the i
m-
portantfeaturesofthe starformationhistory.
Further improvements to the Schwarzschild modeling
method are certainly possible. One way to proceed would be to

includethemodelingofthepropermotionsofthestars.Forn
