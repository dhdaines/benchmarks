ABSTRACT
The technique of norm al-mo de coupling is a p owerful to ol with which to seismically im age non-
axisymmetric phenomena in the Sun. He re we apply mo de coupling in the Cartesian approximation to
prob e s teady, near-surface ows in the Sun. Using Doppler cub es obtained from the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager onb oard the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we p erform inversions on mo de-coupling
measurements to show that the resulting divergence and radial vorticity maps at sup ergranular length
scales (
˘
30 Mm) ne ar the surface compare extremely well with those obtained using the Lo cal Corre-
lation Tracking metho d. We nd that the Pearson correlation co ecient is

0.9 for divergence ows,
while

0.8 is obtained for the radial vorticity.

INTRODUCTION
Helioseismology is the study of the Sun's internal structure and its prop erties, by means of interpreting its eect
on solar oscillations (see
 Chris tensen-Dalsgaard
 2002
, for a review). These are resonant normal mo des of the Sun,
b ehaving as standing waves in a cavity b ounded by the solar s urface and a depth that de p ends on the wavenumb er
of the oscillation. As these waves p enetrate the interior, they register information of the prop erties and dynamics of
the solar interior and return to the surface, where they are observed. The internal structure of the Sun can then b e
retrieved through meticulous inve rsions of these seismic measurements.
Several imp ortant ow systems on the Sun have b een inferred using various global and lo cal helioseismic metho ds.
Of those , the most notable global helioseismic results include inferences on the solar dierential rotation, through
global mo de frequency splitting (
Thompson et al.
 1996
;
 Schou et al.
 1998
), and the resolving the neutrino problem
(
Bahcall & Pinsonneault
 1992
). Notable lo cal helioseismic results include imaging of the meridional ow (
Giles et al.
1997
;
 Gizon et al.
 2020
) through time-distance helioseismology (
Duvall et al.
 1993
), and farside imaging of active
regions (
B raun & Lindsey
 2001
) and their near side emergence (
Birch et al.
 2016
), through helioseismic holography
(
Lindsey & Braun
 2000
). The recent discovery of various inertial waves (
Gizon et al.
 2021
), including the equatorial
Rossby wave (
optien et al.
 2018
), has b een achieved through lo cal helios eismic ring-diagram analysis (
Hill
 1988
) and
the non-helioseismic lo cal correlation tracking (LCT,
 Nove mb er & Simon
 1988
) of granulation.
In recent years, the use of global mo de-coupling helioseismology (
Wo o dard
 1989
 ;
 Lavely & Ritzwoller
 1992
) has
received attention, with many studies seeking to validate and demonstrate the imp ortance of such a technique for
investigating numerous solar phenomena. While the derivation of the mo de-coupling technique is mathematically
challenging, the data analys is is simple and utilizes all the information re gistered by the mo de. Thus far, global
mo de-coupling has b een validated through observations of the meridional ow (
Vorontsov
 2011
;
 Wo o dard et al.
 2013
),
dierential rotation (
Schad & Roth
 2020
;
 Kashyap et al.
 2021
), global-scale convection (
Wo o dard
 2014
,
 2016
;
 Hanasoge
et al.
 2020
;
 Mani & Hanasoge
 2021
) and Rossby mo de s (
Hanasoge & Mandal
 2019
;
 Mandal & Hanasoge
 2020
;
 Mandal
et al.
 2021
). Lo cal mo de-coupling analysis in the Cartesian approximation, formulated by
 Wo o dard
 (
2006
), was
validated by
 Hanson et al.
 (
2021
) (hereafter H21) by examining the p ower-sp e ctrum of sup ergranular waves and
comparing with previous time-distance studies (
Langfellner et al.
 2018
).

Normal-mo de coupling refers to the concept of expressing solar-oscillation eigenfunctions as a linear weighted combi-
nation of mo del-eigenfunctions (e .g ., Mo del S
 Chris tensen-Dalsgaard
 2021
). The mo del eigenfunctions form a complete
and orthog onal basis. By design, the mo del Sun is spherically symm etric , adiabatic, free from rotation, m agne tis m and
ows. In this state, the oscillations are considered to b e uncouple d. The weights needed to express the solar-oscillation
eigenfunctions would then enco de all the p e rturbations that are absent in the mo del. The forward problem then
reduces to relating obse rved seismic measurements to the p e rturbations that we want to infer. The surface waveeld
cross-correlation is the primary measureme nt in the mo de-c oupling analysis and can b e directly related to the weights
(
Wo o dard
 2016
). As mo de coupling is a Fourier domain technique, waveelds are cross-correlated at dierent spatial
and temp oral frequencies, leaving us with measurements sensitive to di erent quantities of interest.
In this study, we extend the sp ectral analysis of H21 and develop the metho d to pro duce near-surface ow maps
at sup ergranulation length scales. A part of the formalism that was used to derive the forward mo del in H21 is
reworked, primarily to imag e steady ows. Measurements are then constructed, and inversions to infer divergence ow
and radial vorticity are describ ed. We also demonstrate signal asso ciated with sup ergranular ow in a radial- order
coupling (p
2
-p
2
), which was not shown in H21. This helps in lo calizing the measurement sensitivity to the surface.
We compare our results with ows obtained using the Lo cal Correlation Tracking metho d on solar granules.
1.1.
Forward problem
In favor of algebraic bre vity, we only show crucial steps he re and refer the interested reader to App endix
 A
 for a
complete derivation of the forward problem. Working in the plane- parallel atmosphere (se e also
 Wo o dard
 2006
), we
denote the horizontal unit vectors
e
x
and
e
y
in our lo cal Cartesian domain as p ointing towards wes t and north on the
solar surface, resp ectively, and
e
z
p oints outwards. This approximation is valid when observing patches of the surface
that are small when compared to the solar radius. When imaging steady, near-surface ows in the ne ighb ourho o d
of the sup e rgranular scale (
˘
30 Mm), we exp ect the measured sp ectral cross -correlation signal to p eak around the
horizontal wavenumb er

j
is the vector horizontal
wavenumb er of the ow. Ac cordingly, the goal is to relate measureme nts (linearly, to facilitate inversion) to the ow
p erturbation describ ed in a horizontal Fourier domain. Sup ergranular velo cities are subsonic (300-400 m/s, see
 Rincon
& Rieutord

), p ermitting us to mo del the ow vector

Noise model
In the addition to the sensitivity kernels, a systematic background noise mo del is required to infer the ows from
the observed
B
-co ecients. For estimating the contribution from realization noise to the measurements, we make the
following assumptions (
Gizon & Birch
 2004
): that the excitation of the wave e ld is mo delled as a multivariate Gaussian
random pro cess and the waveelds are uncorrelated across wavenumb er and frequency in the absence of p erturbations.
Every indep endent realization of a mo de can b e understo o d as the output of a damp e d harmonic oscillator driven by a
random forcing function (see
 Duvall & Harvey
 1986
). Mo des are thus generated with random phases and amplitude s
and with nite lifetime s. This sto chasticity leads to realiza tion noise in rep eated measurements of mo de para meters

DATA ANALYSIS
In order to examine near surface ows we build a time-series cub e of Doppler images that are obtained from the
Helioseismic Magnetic Imager ab oard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (HMI/SDO,
 Scherrer et al.
 2012
). Each image
is Postel pro jected, with a spatial resolution of approximately 0
:
48Mm, sp erated in tim e by 45 seconds, and is tracked
at the (
Sno dgrass
 1984
) rotation rate. Here, we select a patch that is 194
:
4

194
:
4 Mm
2
in size, tracked for 24 hours
and crosses the disk-center in the middle of observation time on the 14 Novemeb er 2017 (Carrington rotation numb er
2197, Carrington longitude 90

). This Dopplercub e is c ons idere d as the physical waveeld
˚
(
x; y
;
t
). The Fourier-space
waveeld
˚
!
k
(and subsequently, the cross-correlation
˚
!

k
˚
!
k
+
q
) is obtained by c omputing the 3D spatial and temp oral
Fourier transform of the Dopplercub e .
The duration of the observed region is long enough to provide sucient frequency bins with which to sum over in
Eq
 6
, while short enough that sup ergranules do not substantially evolve (lifetime is purp orted to b e 1.6 days;
 Rincon
& Rieutord
 2018
) over this p erio d. Our observation region is close to the disk center to also avoid any contamination
from center-to-limb systematics (
Zhao et al.
 2012
;
 Langfellner et al.
 2015
).
Maximum signal can b e extracted from the weighted summation of the cross correlations (eq
 5
) when the sp ectral
proles of the two mo des [
n; k
] and [
n
0
; k

] closely align in

space. This implie s that their mo de fre que nc ie s should b e

observation set the total numb er of mo des within a range of

INVERSION
The nal step to pro ducing near-surface ow maps in Cartesian mo de-coupling is to invert the measurements
B
k
;
q
from the linear relation in eq
 6
. We describ e inversion using regularized-least-s quares (RLS) metho d here and
leave Subtractive Optimally Lo calized Averages (SOLA,
 Pijp ers & Thompson
 1994
) for App endix
 B
. The metho ds
complement each other (see
 Sekii
 1997
), where RLS tries to minimize the mist b etween data and mo del, whereas
SOLA gives b etter lo c aliz ation. For total numb er of mo des
M
, RLS scales as
M
x
J
where
J
is the numb er of basis
functions
f
j
(
z
) (
J
˝
M
; see eq
 3
 and sec tion
 3.1
), whereas SOLA s cales as
M
2
(see App endix
 B
). For
M >
5000,
computation starts to quickly b ecome exp e ns ive for SOLA.
Mo de eigenfunctions p eak near the surface, with higher radial orders p os sessing smaller p eaks in the interior. While
f-f coupling alone has enough sensitivity to prob e p erturbations at sup ergranular scales close to surface, signal is
present even in p
1
-p
1
, and p
2
-p
2
(see Figure
 3
), and p ossibly other higher order self- and cross-couplings. Since we are
interested in only surface ows, we leave higher order coupling to future work.
It b ears mentioning that the slop es of the ridge s in the
k R

-

sp ectrum (Figure
 1
) increase with radial order. This
limits us to low-to-intermediate
k R

(
<
1000) for these higher radial orders if we are to remain under the acoustic cut-
o frequency of 5.3mHz. It also b ecomes imp erative to use a spatially larger obse rvation patch to gain access to signals
from low
k R

- to o large an observation region could p ossibly render invalid the Cartesian geometry approximation.
Regardless, in addition to p erforming inversions using all the couplings stacked together, we also demonstrate inversions
separately for the three couplings (see Table
 2
) in order to account for the full gamut of mo de-coupling as a signal-rich
helioseismic te chnique.

LCT
To improve condence in the imaged near-surface ows through mo de-coupling, we compare them with ows obtained
from Lo cal Correlation Tracking metho d (LCT;
 Novemb er & Simon
 1988
). LCT provides surface-ow maps by
examining the advection of convective granules (1.2 Mm,
q R

ˇ
3500;
 Hathaway et al.
 2015
) by underlying larger-
scale ow systems . Since granules are used as tracers, which are much smaller in size than sup ergranules (
ˇ
35 Mm),
LCT is an eective metho d (see
 Rieutord et al.
 2001
) to pro duce surface horizontal ow maps of sup ergranulation.
Time series of intensity im ages from HMI, with the same prop erties of the Dopplercub es describ ed in section
 2
(tracking rate, date, lo cation, siz e and duration of obs erved patch, spatial and temp oral sampling rate ), are ob-
tained and Postel pro jecte d. The horizontal ows are deduced by tracking the prop er motions of granules b etween
consecutive intensity images, which we denote as
I
1
;
I
2
. The LCT metho d selects a patch in two images e ach

A Gaussian of width

. The two patches

We follow similar steps to those taken in
 Langfellner et al.
 (
2015
) for comparison of ow maps with LCT. The
essential step for comparison at dierent length scales is to bandpass lter the Fourier-space ow around the
q R

of
interest (see Figure
 4
), and subsequently convert it to real space.
We seek to show comparisons (see Figures
 5
,
 6
, and
 7
) for
q R

= 100, 150, 200 and 250. To suciently delineate
ows at these length scales , we apply a Ga us sian lter (see Figure
 4
) to ows obtained from eqns
 16
 and
 17
. The
Gaussian is centered at the des ire d wavenumb er with a half-width of 25. We then p erform a 2D Fourier transform to
obtain a real-space steady-ow map.

RESULTS
Table
 2
 summarizes the results of the comparison b etween ows obtained from mo de-coupling and LCT. Figure
 5
,
where we have used all the couplings to p erform inversions, shows a 97% correlation b etween divergence ows from
the two metho ds near sup e rgranular scale (
q R

ˇ
100). Near-surface ows are imaged most faithfully when all the
couplings are used. Since vortical ow s are imaged at a region near the equator, it is p ossible that the source of
vorticity is something other than Coriolis force. Nevertheless, there is also a very go o d agreement (87%) b etween
the vortical ows as inferred from the two metho ds, despite b eing an order of m agnitude weaker than the divergence
ows (this is consistent with the results of
 Hathaway et al.
 2015
;
 Langfellner et al.
 2015
;
 Rincon et al.
 2017
). Due to
insucient mo des for the p
2
-p
2
case (se e Table
 1
), we are unable to infer vortical ows with conviction other than near
the sup ergranular scale, as can b e see n from Table
 2
. Figure
 6
 also aligns with what we b elieve can b e accomplished
through mo de-coupling helioseismology - using f- f or p
1
-p
1
alone to seismically infer ne ar- surface divergence and vortical
ows at dierent scales (
q R

= 100
;
150) can yield extremely go o d agreement with LCT. As the length scale of the
inferred ow moves further away from that of sup ergranules (Figure
 7
), the demand on signal-to-noise also increases.
An adequate numb er of mo des (and coupling strength b etween higher radial-orders) thus b ecomes a necessity to
comment substantively on the ows at these scales .

). Corresp onding scatter plots and correlation co ecients are shown in the b ottom row. We cut edges
out from the ow maps and compare a circular region of diameter
ˇ
175 Mm. The slop es of the b est-t line through the scatter
plots are 0.51 for divergence and 0.01 f or vorticity. The vorticity ow maps are saturated to show only 40% of the maximum
values.
For b oth LCT and mo de-coupling divergence and vorticity maps, numerous factors, arising from the as so ciated
numerous data pro ces sing steps, can inuence the nal inference of ow amplitudes, making it dicult to put forward
a precise statement on them. H21 rep orted a 60% greater amplitude for p
1
-p
1
over f-f coupling (Figure
 3
 reects a
similar conclusion), another element to consider when combining dierent radial orders. The choice of regularization
(see right panel of Figure
 2
) has the p otential to aect the amplitudes of the inverted ows to some degree. Flow
amplitudes also vary with depth, implying that dierent radial orders and LC T will measure dierent ow averages.
This variability eme rge s as a natural consequence of any helioseismic inversion pro cedure neces sitating the use of a
radial grid along which kerne ls and ows tend to b e des crib ed.
Thus, the amplitudes of the mo de-coupling ows (and the correlation c o ecient) de p end up on the following factors:
‹
Coupling(s) used,
‹
Regularization parameter in the inversion,
‹
Smo othing applied to LCT ows (indirectly; see b elow paragraph),
‹
The depth at which ows are inferred.
Here, we rep ort in Table
 2
 only the maximum correlation found from among the p oints in the radial grid close
to the surface (within

0.5 Mm from
z
=0). For a desired comparison length sc ale
q R

, we rst x the coupling(s)
and the regularization parameter to b e used in the inversion. We then separately compute ltered divergence and

It has b een shown (see

for divergence ows owing to the multi-step pro cess involved in obtaining them. For example, there has b een a history

In this work, we have develop ed inversions to show that the Cartesian approximation of mo de-coupling can b e used
with great condence to inves tigate ows near the surface. Careful inversions of mo de-coupling measurements, built
using a suciently large mo deset tha t p enetrates into the deep er layers of the convection zone, can also enable probing
of the depth structure and time-evolution of sup ergranules, part of future work. With enough mo des to improve
signal-to-noise through larger observation sizes , we suggest that Cartesian mo de-coupling can nd lo cal helioseismic
applications to investigate other depth- and time-varying fea tures such as giant cell ows (see
 Hathaway et al.

;
Hanson et al.

SOLA INVERSIONS
Subtractive Optimally Lo calized Averages (SOLA,
 Pijp ers & Thompson
 1994
) aims to obtain a set of weight factors
for the mo de

allows for an average value of the ow
P
q
(

) to b e estimated at the depth
z

. To obtain the co ecients

k
;z o
, it is as sumed that a set of sensitivity kernels
K
k
;
q
(
z
) for the mo de
q
can b e summed up coherently to give an
'averaging kernel' that is lo calized at the depth
z
o
. Conventionally, a Gaussian centered at
z
o
and a width  is chosen
which the averaging kernel should resemble after p erforming inversion.
B.1.
Kernels in th e integral form
Since the ke rnels in eq
 A6
 are manifest as co ecients on a basis
f
j
(
z
), we rst derive kerne ls that can b e expressed
as a function of depth
z
(see Figure

). It is convenient to derive in matrix form. Thus, with the following denitions :

;
q
(
z
), we write (assume only p oloidal ow for
simplicity, the same derivations hold true for toroidal ow as well)
P
=
F p
(B11)
The size of
P
is thus the same as the length of the radial grid
z
.
Now, pre-multiply by
F
T
and integrate over
z
on b oth sides (drop the integral notation for compactness),
F

= (
