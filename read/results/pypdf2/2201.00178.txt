ABSTRACT
The technique of normal-mode coupling is a powerful tool with which to seismically image non-
axisymmetric phenomena in the Sun. Here we apply mode coupling in the Cartesian approximation to
probe steady, near-surface ows in the Sun. Using Doppler cubes obtained from the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we perform inversions on mode-coupling
measurements to show that the resulting divergence and radial vorticity maps at supergranular length
scales (
˘
30 Mm) near the surface compare extremely well with those obtained using the Local Corre-
lation Tracking method. We nd that the Pearson correlation coecient is

0.9 for divergence ows,
while

0.8 is obtained for the radial vorticity.

INTRODUCTION
Helioseismology is the study of the Sun's internal structure and its properties, by means of interpreting its eect
on solar oscillations (see
 Christensen-Dalsgaard
 2002
, for a review). These are resonant normal modes of the Sun,
behaving as standing waves in a cavity bounded by the solar surface and a depth that depends on the wavenumber
of the oscillation. As these waves penetrate the interior, they register information of the properties and dynamics of
the solar interior and return to the surface, where they are observed. The internal structure of the Sun can then be
retrieved through meticulous inversions of these seismic measurements.
Several important ow systems on the Sun have been inferred using various global and local helioseismic methods.
Of those, the most notable global helioseismic results include inferences on the solar dierential rotation, through
global mode frequency splitting (
Thompson et al.
 1996
;
 Schou et al.
 1998
), and the resolving the neutrino problem
(
Bahcall & Pinsonneault
 1992
). Notable local helioseismic results include imaging of the meridional ow (
Giles et al.
1997
;
 Gizon et al.
 2020
) through time-distance helioseismology (
Duvall et al.
 1993
), and farside imaging of active
regions (
Braun & Lindsey
 2001
) and their near side emergence (
Birch et al.
 2016
), through helioseismic holography
(
Lindsey & Braun
 2000
). The recent discovery of various inertial waves (
Gizon et al.
 2021
), including the equatorial
Rossby wave (
optien et al.
 2018
), has been achieved through local helioseismic ring-diagram analysis (
Hill
 1988
) and
the non-helioseismic local correlation tracking (LCT,
 November & Simon
 1988
) of granulation.
In recent years, the use of global mode-coupling helioseismology (
Woodard
 1989
;
 Lavely & Ritzwoller
 1992
) has
received attention, with many studies seeking to validate and demonstrate the importance of such a technique for
investigating numerous solar phenomena. While the derivation of the mode-coupling technique is mathematically
challenging, the data analysis is simple and utilizes all the information registered by the mode. Thus far, global
mode-coupling has been validated through observations of the meridional ow (
Vorontsov
 2011
;
 Woodard et al.
 2013
),
dierential rotation (
Schad & Roth
 2020
;
 Kashyap et al.
 2021
), global-scale convection (
Woodard
 2014
,
 2016
;
 Hanasoge
et al.
 2020
;
 Mani & Hanasoge
 2021
) and Rossby modes (
Hanasoge & Mandal
 2019
;
 Mandal & Hanasoge
 2020
;
 Mandal
et al.
 2021
). Local mode-coupling analysis in the Cartesian approximation, formulated by
 Woodard
 (
2006
), was
validated by
 Hanson et al.
 (
2021
) (hereafter H21) by examining the power-spectrum of supergranular waves and
comparing with previous time-distance studies (
Langfellner et al.
 2018
).

Normal-mode coupling refers to the concept of expressing solar-oscillation eigenfunctions as a linear weighted combi-
nation of model-eigenfunctions (e.g., Model S
 Christensen-Dalsgaard
 2021
). The model eigenfunctions form a complete
and orthogonal basis. By design, the model Sun is spherically symmetric, adiabatic, free from rotation, magnetism and
ows. In this state, the oscillations are considered to be uncoupled. The weights needed to express the solar-oscillation
eigenfunctions would then encode all the perturbations that are absent in the model. The forward problem then
reduces to relating observed seismic measurements to the perturbations that we want to infer. The surface waveeld
cross-correlation is the primary measurement in the mode-coupling analysis and can be directly related to the weights
(
Woodard
 2016
). As mode coupling is a Fourier domain technique, waveelds are cross-correlated at dierent spatial
and temporal frequencies, leaving us with measurements sensitive to dierent quantities of interest.
In this study, we extend the spectral analysis of H21 and develop the method to produce near-surface ow maps
at supergranulation length scales. A part of the formalism that was used to derive the forward model in H21 is
reworked, primarily to image steady ows. Measurements are then constructed, and inversions to infer divergence ow
and radial vorticity are described. We also demonstrate signal associated with supergranular ow in a radial-order
coupling (p
2
-p
2
), which was not shown in H21. This helps in localizing the measurement sensitivity to the surface.
We compare our results with ows obtained using the Local Correlation Tracking method on solar granules.
1.1.
Forward problem
In favor of algebraic brevity, we only show crucial steps here and refer the interested reader to Appendix
 A
 for a
complete derivation of the forward problem. Working in the plane-parallel atmosphere (see also
 Woodard
 2006
), we
denote the horizontal unit vectors
e
x
and
e
y
in our local Cartesian domain as pointing towards west and north on the
solar surface, respectively, and
e
z
points outwards. This approximation is valid when observing patches of the surface
that are small when compared to the solar radius. When imaging steady, near-surface ows in the neighbourhood
of the supergranular scale (
˘
30 Mm), we expect the measured spectral cross-correlation signal to peak around the
horizontal wavenumber

q

q
j
=
j
(

;q

)
j
is the vector horizontal
wavenumber of the ow. Accordingly, the goal is to relate measurements (linearly, to facilitate inversion) to the ow
perturbation described in a horizontal Fourier domain. Supergranular velocities are subsonic (300-400 m/s, see
 Rincon
& Rieutord
 2018
), permitting us to model the ow vector

is the 3D gradient operator. While mode-coupling can easily be extended to study time-varying
perturbations (see
 Woodard

;
 Mani & Hanasoge

 Hanasoge et al.
 2020
;
 Mandal & Hanasoge

, for
example), here we only consider the frequency bin
˙

of analysis. We therefore suppress

from all terms this point forward, remembering that temporal dynamics of
perturbations may also be studied using the same model outlined in the following paragraphs. Simplifying eq

Fourier domain, and since we wish to image horizontal ows on a small patch of the surface, we describe the ow as a

and depth

. Hence the poloidal and toroidal ows are described by

Noise model
In the addition to the sensitivity kernels, a systematic background noise model is required to infer the ows from
the observed
B
-coecients. For estimating the contribution from realization noise to the measurements, we make the
following assumptions (
Gizon & Birch
 2004
): that the excitation of the waveeld is modelled as a multivariate Gaussian
random process and the waveelds are uncorrelated across wavenumber and frequency in the absence of perturbations.
Every independent realization of a mode can be understood as the output of a damped harmonic oscillator driven by a
random forcing function (see
 Duvall & Harvey
 1986
). Modes are thus generated with random phases and amplitudes
and with nite lifetimes. This stochasticity leads to realization noise in repeated measurements of mode parameters

DATA ANALYSIS
In order to examine near surface ows we build a time-series cube of Doppler images that are obtained from the
Helioseismic Magnetic Imager aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (HMI/SDO,
 Scherrer et al.
 2012
). Each image
is Postel projected, with a spatial resolution of approximately 0
:
48Mm, sperated in time by 45 seconds, and is tracked
at the (
Snodgrass
 1984
) rotation rate. Here, we select a patch that is 194
:
4

194
:
4 Mm
2
in size, tracked for 24 hours
and crosses the disk-center in the middle of observation time on the 14 Novemeber 2017 (Carrington rotation number
2197, Carrington longitude 90

). This Dopplercube is considered as the physical waveeld
˚
(
x;y
;
t
). The Fourier-space
waveeld
˚
!
k
(and subsequently, the cross-correlation
˚
!

k
˚
!
k
+
q
) is obtained by computing the 3D spatial and temporal
Fourier transform of the Dopplercube.
The duration of the observed region is long enough to provide sucient frequency bins with which to sum over in
Eq
 6
, while short enough that supergranules do not substantially evolve (lifetime is purported to be 1.6 days;
 Rincon
& Rieutord
 2018
) over this period. Our observation region is close to the disk center to also avoid any contamination
from center-to-limb systematics (
Zhao et al.
 2012
;
 Langfellner et al.
 2015
).
Maximum signal can be extracted from the weighted summation of the cross correlations (eq
 5
) when the spectral
proles of the two modes [
n;k
] and [
n
0
;k
0
] closely align in
!
space. This implies that their mode frequencies should be
suciently close (

), mode frequencies

become spaced
farther apart with increasing wavenumber
kR

. It is also known that mode linewidth grows with radial orders for
a given
kR

. Moreover, holding the spatial and temporal sampling rates constant, the spatial size and duration of
observation set the total number of modes within a range of
kR

(and
!=

ˇ
) that can be clearly observed, thereby
aecting the quality of the seismic measurements. Owing to these factors, to maximize signal-to-noise (by visually
inspecting the power-spectrum), the parameters describing the extent of coupling over dierent ranges of
kR

at xed
radial order are dierent. In wavenumber, we restrict our analysis to within 200

INVERSION
The nal step to producing near-surface ow maps in Cartesian mode-coupling is to invert the measurements
B
k
;
q
from the linear relation in eq
 6
. We describe inversion using regularized-least-squares (RLS) method here and
leave Subtractive Optimally Localized Averages (SOLA,
 Pijpers & Thompson
 1994
) for Appendix
 B
. The methods
complement each other (see
 Sekii
 1997
), where RLS tries to minimize the mist between data and model, whereas
SOLA gives better localization. For total number of modes
M
, RLS scales as
M
x
J
where
J
is the number of basis
functions
f
j
(
z
) (
J
˝
M
; see eq
 3
 and section
 3.1
), whereas SOLA scales as
M
2
(see Appendix
 B
). For
M >
5000,
computation starts to quickly become expensive for SOLA.
Mode eigenfunctions peak near the surface, with higher radial orders possessing smaller peaks in the interior. While
f-f coupling alone has enough sensitivity to probe perturbations at supergranular scales close to surface, signal is
present even in p
1
-p
1
, and p
2
-p
2
(see Figure
 3
), and possibly other higher order self- and cross-couplings. Since we are
interested in only surface ows, we leave higher order coupling to future work.
It bears mentioning that the slopes of the ridges in the
kR

-

spectrum (Figure
 1
) increase with radial order. This
limits us to low-to-intermediate
kR

(
<
1000) for these higher radial orders if we are to remain under the acoustic cut-
o frequency of 5.3mHz. It also becomes imperative to use a spatially larger observation patch to gain access to signals
from low
kR

- too large an observation region could possibly render invalid the Cartesian geometry approximation.
Regardless, inadditiontoperforminginversionsusingallthecouplingsstackedtogether, wealsodemonstrateinversions
separately for the three couplings (see Table
 2
) in order to account for the full gamut of mode-coupling as a signal-rich
helioseismic technique.

LCT
Toimprovecondenceintheimagednear-surfaceowsthroughmode-coupling, wecomparethemwithowsobtained
from Local Correlation Tracking method (LCT;
 November & Simon
 1988
). LCT provides surface-ow maps by
examining the advection of convective granules (1.2 Mm,
qR

ˇ
3500;
 Hathaway et al.
 2015
) by underlying larger-
scale ow systems. Since granules are used as tracers, which are much smaller in size than supergranules (
ˇ
35 Mm),
LCT is an eective method (see
 Rieutord et al.
 2001
) to produce surface horizontal ow maps of supergranulation.
Time series of intensity images from HMI, with the same properties of the Dopplercubes described in section
 2
(tracking rate, date, location, size and duration of observed patch, spatial and temporal sampling rate), are ob-
tained and Postel projected. The horizontal ows are deduced by tracking the proper motions of granules between
consecutive intensity images, which we denote as
I
1
;
I
2
. The LCT method selects a patch in two images each

).
A Gaussian of width
sigma
allows to isolate a small region surrounding the grid point of interest as the distance
moved by granules are usually in sub-pixel regime. The convention for the direction of
x
is the same as described in
section
 1.1
. The two patches

The shift 

Provided that the time dierence 

. FLCT
requires the input

We follow similar steps to those taken in
 Langfellner et al.
 (
2015
) for comparison of ow maps with LCT. The
essential step for comparison at dierent length scales is to bandpass lter the Fourier-space ow around the
qR

of
interest (see Figure
 4
), and subsequently convert it to real space.
We seek to show comparisons (see Figures
 5
,
 6
, and
 7
) for
qR

= 100, 150, 200 and 250. To suciently delineate
ows at these length scales, we apply a Gaussian lter (see Figure
 4
) to ows obtained from eqns
 16
 and
 17
. The
Gaussian is centered at the desired wavenumber with a half-width of 25. We then perform a 2D Fourier transform to
obtain a real-space steady-ow map.

RESULTS
Table
 2
 summarizes the results of the comparison between ows obtained from mode-coupling and LCT. Figure
 5
,
where we have used all the couplings to perform inversions, shows a 97% correlation between divergence ows from
the two methods near supergranular scale (
qR

ˇ
100). Near-surface ows are imaged most faithfully when all the
couplings are used. Since vortical ows are imaged at a region near the equator, it is possible that the source of
vorticity is something other than Coriolis force. Nevertheless, there is also a very good agreement (87%) between
the vortical ows as inferred from the two methods, despite being an order of magnitude weaker than the divergence
ows (this is consistent with the results of
 Hathaway et al.
 2015
;
 Langfellner et al.
 2015
;
 Rincon et al.
 2017
). Due to
insucient modes for the p
2
-p
2
case (see Table
 1
), we are unable to infer vortical ows with conviction other than near
the supergranular scale, as can be seen from Table
 2
. Figure

 also aligns with what we believe can be accomplished
throughmode-couplinghelioseismology-usingf-forp

alonetoseismicallyinfernear-surfacedivergenceandvortical
ows at dierent scales (
qR

= 100
;
150) can yield extremely good agreement with LCT. As the length scale of the
inferred ow moves further away from that of supergranules (Figure
 7
), the demand on signal-to-noise also increases.
An adequate number of modes (and coupling strength between higher radial-orders) thus becomes a necessity to
comment substantively on the ows at these scales.

= 100 (see Figure

). Corresponding scatter plots and correlation coecients are shown in the bottom row. We cut edges
out from the ow maps and compare a circular region of diameter
ˇ
175 Mm. The slopes of the best-t line through the scatter
plots are 0.51 for divergence and 0.01 for vorticity. The vorticity ow maps are saturated to show only 40% of the maximum
values.
For both LCT and mode-coupling divergence and vorticity maps, numerous factors, arising from the associated
numerous data processing steps, can inuence the nal inference of ow amplitudes, making it dicult to put forward
a precise statement on them. H21 reported a 60% greater amplitude for p
1
-p
1
over f-f coupling (Figure
 3
 reects a
similar conclusion), another element to consider when combining dierent radial orders. The choice of regularization
(see right panel of Figure
 2
) has the potential to aect the amplitudes of the inverted ows to some degree. Flow
amplitudes also vary with depth, implying that dierent radial orders and LCT will measure dierent ow averages.
This variability emerges as a natural consequence of any helioseismic inversion procedure necessitating the use of a
radial grid along which kernels and ows tend to be described.
Thus, the amplitudes of the mode-coupling ows (and the correlation coecient) depend upon the following factors:
‹
Coupling(s) used,
‹
Regularization parameter in the inversion,
‹
Smoothing applied to LCT ows (indirectly; see below paragraph),
‹
The depth at which ows are inferred.
Here, we report in Table
 2
 only the maximum correlation found from among the points in the radial grid close
to the surface (within

0.5 Mm from
z
=0). For a desired comparison length scale
qR

, we rst x the coupling(s)
and the regularization parameter to be used in the inversion. We then separately compute ltered divergence and

In this work, we have developed inversions to show that the Cartesian approximation of mode-coupling can be used
with great condence to investigate ows near the surface. Careful inversions of mode-coupling measurements, built
using a suciently large modeset that penetrates into the deeper layers of the convection zone, can also enable probing
of the depth structure and time-evolution of supergranules, part of future work. With enough modes to improve
signal-to-noise through larger observation sizes, we suggest that Cartesian mode-coupling can nd local helioseismic
applications to investigate other depth- and time-varying features such as giant cell ows (see
 Hathaway et al.
 2013
;
Hanson et al.

), emerging active regions, meridional ows and Rossby waves.

SOLA INVERSIONS
Subtractive Optimally Localized Averages (SOLA,
 Pijpers & Thompson
 1994
) aims to obtain a set of weight factors
for the mode
q
and depth
z

, which we will call

k
;zo
. A linear weighted sum of the measurements
B

q

k
;zo
B
k
;
q
allows for an average value of the ow
P
q
(
z
) to be estimated at the depth
z
o
. To obtain the coecients

k
;zo
, it is assumed that a set of sensitivity kernels
K
k
;
q
(
z
) for the mode
q
can be summed up coherently to give an
'averaging kernel' that is localized at the depth
z
o
. Conventionally, a Gaussian centered at
z
o
and a width  is chosen
which the averaging kernel should resemble after performing inversion.
B.1.
Kernels in the integral form
Since the kernels in eq
 A6
 are manifest as coecients on a basis
f
j
(
z
), we rst derive kernels that can be expressed
as a function of depth
z
(see Figure
 8
). It is convenient to derive in matrix form. Thus, with the following denitions:
P

P
q

z

k
;
q
(
z
), we write (assume only poloidal ow for
simplicity, the same derivations hold true for toroidal ow as well)
P
=
Fp
(B11)
The size of
P
is thus the same as the length of the radial grid
z
.
Now, pre-multiply by
F
T
and integrate over
z
on both sides (drop the integral notation for compactness),
F

P
= (

As an aside, we note that averaging kernels can similarly be constructed for RLS (see section

 B18
, we introduce regularization using an Identity

thus becomes a highly expensive computationally for very large number of modes (see section
