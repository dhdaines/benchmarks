ABSTRACT
Most stellar evolution mo dels predict that black holes (BHs) should not exist ab ove approximately
50

70 M

. However, recent LIGO/Virgo detections indicate the e xis tence of BHs with masses at and
ab ove this threshold. We suggest that massive BHs, including intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs),
can form in galactic nuclei through collisions b etween stellar-mass black holes and the surrounding
main-sequence stars. Considering dynamical pro c esses such as collisions, mass segregation, and relax-
ation, we nd that this channel can b e quite ecient, forming IMBHs as massive as 10
4
M

. Our
results suggest that mass ive black holes and IMBHs may b e ubiquitous in galactic centres. This for-
mation channel als o has implications for observations . Collisions b etween stars and BHs can pro duce
electromagnetic signatures, for example, from x-ray binaries and tidal disruption events. Additionally,
formed through this channel, b oth black holes in the mass gap and IMBHs can merge with the sup er-
massive black hole at the center of a galactic nucleus through gravitational waves. These gravitational
wave events are extreme and intermediate mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs and IMRIs, res p ectively).

INTRODUCTION
The rec ently detected gravitational wave source
GW190521 (

) pro duce d an intermediate mass black hole of
approximately 142 M

. This event may have also had a
85 M

progenitor, which falls within the pair-instability
mass gap that limits stellar black holes (BHs) to no
more than
Ë˜
<
50 M

(e.g.,
 He ger et al.
 2003
;
 Wo osley

)

. Similarly, the merger pro ducts of GW150914,
GW170104, and GW170814 fall within the mass gap
(e.g.,
 Abb ott et al.
 2016
,

,

). BH mergers that
form second generation BHs and, in some cases , inter-
mediate mass B Hs (IMBHs), these gravitational wave
(GW) events can o ccur in globular clusters, young stel-
lar clusters, or the eld (e.g.,

own g alac tic center may host an IMBH in the inner p c
(e.g.,

).
Several IMBH formation channels have b ee n suggested
in the literature. For example, IMBHs may have a cos-
mological origin, forming in the early universe e ither
as a result of the very rst stars (e.g.,
 Madau & Rees
2001
;
 Schneider et al.
 2002
;
 Johnson & Bromm
 2007
;
Valiante e t al.
 2016
) or from dire ct collapse of acc umu-
lated gas (e.g.,
 Begelman et al.
 2006
;
 Yue et al.
 2014
;
Ferrara et al.
 2014
;
 Choi et al.
 2015
;
 Shlosman e t al.
2016
). These high redshift IMBHs would need to sur-
vive galaxy evolution and mergers to present day (e.g.,
Rashkov & Madau
 2014
), with signicant eects on their
stellar and even dark matter surroundings (e.g.,
 Bertone
et al.
 2009
;
 Che n & Liu
 2013
;
 Bringmann et al.
 2012
;
 Eda
et al.
 2013
;
 Naoz & Silk
 2014
;
 Naoz et al.
 2019
). Another
p opular formation channel relies on the coalescence of
many stellar-mass black holes. For example, IMBHs
may form in the centers of globular clusters, where few-
b o dy interactions lead to the merger of stellar-mass BHs
(e.g.,
 O'Leary et al.

Rose et al.
driguez et al.
 2018
;
 Ro driguez et al.
 2019
;
 Fragio ne et al.
2020b
). Other formation mechanisms invoke successive
collisions and mergers of massive stars (e.g.,
 Portegies
Zwart & McMillan
 2002
;
 Portegies Zwart et al.
 2004
;
Freitag et al.
 2006
;
 Kremer et al.
 2020
;
 Gonzalez et al.
2021
;
 Di Carlo et al.
 2021
).
The main obstacle to sequential BH mergers in clus-
ters is that the merger recoil velo city kick often e xceeds
the escap e velo city from the cluster (e.g.,
 Schnittman
& Buonanno
 2007
;
 Centrella et al.
 2010
;
 O'Leary et al.
2006
;
 Baibhav et al.
 2020
, Ro m & Sari, in prep.). How-
ever, nuclear star clusters at the centers of galaxies do
not encounter this problem. For example,
 Fragione et al.
(
2021
) explore rep eated BH-BH mergers in nuclea r star
clusters without a SMBH. They considered BH binary-
single interactions, binary BH GW merger, and GW
merger recoil kicks. The p ost-kick merger pro duct sinks
back towards the cluster center over a dynamical fric-
tion timescale. Using this approach, they showed that
10

M

IMBHs can form e ciently over the life-
time of a cluster.
Howe ver, as discussed in Section
 2.2
, direct star-BH
collisions are much more frequent than BH-BH collision
in galactic nuclei, making the former a promising chan-
nel for BH growth. We prop os e that IMBHs can form
naturally within the central p c of a SMBH in a galactic
center. Sp e cically, these IMBHs form through rep eated
collisions with
main sequence stars
, accreting some or
all of the star's mass dep ending on the details of the
collision. We demonstrate that this channel can create
IMBHs with masses as large as 10
4
M

, dep ending on
the density prole of the surrounding stars.
The pap er is s tructured as follows: we describ e rele-
vant physical pro cesses and our approach in Section
 2
.
In particular, we provide an overview of collisions in
Section
 2.2
 and present our statistical approach in Sec-
tion
 2.3
. Section
 2.4
 discusses our treatment of the
mass growth with each collision and presents analytic
solutions to our equations in two dierent regimes, ef-
cient collisions and inecient collisions We compare
these solutions to our statistical results. Sections
 2.5
and
 2.7
 discuss im plic ations for GW merger events b e-
twe en IMBHs and the SMBH. We the n incorp orate re-
laxation pro cesses and discuss the subsequent results in
Section
 2.8
. Finally, we discuss and summarize our nd-
ings in Section
 3
.

METHODOLOGY
We consider a p opulation of stellar mass BHs emb ed-
ded in a cluster of 1 M

stars. When stars and BHs
collide, the BHs can accrete mass. The growth rate de -
p ends on the physical pro cesses outlined b elow. We use
a statistical approach to estimate the stellar encounters
and nal IMB H masses.
2.1.
Physical Picture
We consider a p opulation of BHs within the inner few
parsecs of the SMBH in a galactic nucleus (GN). We as-
sume that the BH mass distribution follows that of the
stars from which they originate, a Kroupa initial mass
function
dN =dm
/
m

2
:
35
. While this choice represents
a gross oversimplication, it has very little b earing on
our nal results. Future work may address the particu-
lars of the BH mass distribution, but we do not exp ect
that it will signicantly alter the outcome. The upp er
and lower limits of the BH mass distribution are 5 and
50
M

, resp ectively. We select the upp er limit to en-
compass the range of upp er b ounds predicted by stellar
evolution mo de ls , which vary b etween 40 and 125
M

dep ending on the metallicity (
Heger et al.
 2003
;
 Wo osley
2017

 Sp era & Map elli
 2017b
;
 Limongi & Chie
 2018b
;
Belczynski et al.
 2020b
;
 Renzo e t al.
 2020
). We assume
that the orbits of the BHs follow a thermal eccentricity
distribution. We draw their semima jor axes,
a

, from a
uniform distribution in log distance,
dN =d
(log
r
) b eing
constant. While this distribution is not necessarily rep-
resentative of actual conditions in the GN, we use it to
build a comprehensive physical picture of BH growth at
all distances from the SMBH, including within 0
:
01 p c.
Otherwise, the innermost region of the GN would b e
p o orly represented in our sample. We consider other
observationally motivated distributions in Section
 2.8
,
but reserve a more detailed exam ination of the distribu-
tion's impact for future work.
2.2.
Direct Col lisions
BHs in the GN can undergo dire ct collisions w ith other
ob je cts. The timescale for this pro cess,

We plot the relevant timescales, including col-
lision (green), relaxation (gold), and BH-BH GW capture
(purple), for a single BH in the GN as a function of distance
from the SMBH. For the collision timescale, we assume the
BH is on a circular orbit. The timescales dep end on the
density, so we adopt a range of density proles, b ounded by

= 1 (dashed curve) to

= 2 (dark, solid curve). The dark
blue line represents the time for a 10

BH to merge with
the SMB H through GW emission.
that this timescale equation includes the eects of grav-
itational fo c us ing, which enhances the cross-section of
interaction.
Assuming a circular orbit for simplicity, we plot the
timescale for a BH orbiting in the GN to collide with
a 1
M

star as a function of dis tanc e from the SMBH
in Figure

As this time scale dep ends on the density

such that our ducial GN
matches our own galactic c enter (e .g.,
 Ghez et al.
 2005
;
Genzel et al.

). In this case, the normalization in
Eq. (

We note that the eccentricity has a very minor eect on the
collision timescale (
Rose et al.

The collision timescale also dep e nds on the velo city dis-
p ersion, which we express as:

de-
notes the mass of the SMBH (
Alexander
 1999
;
 Alexan-
der & Pfuhl
 2014
). As mentioned ab ove, Eq. (
1
) dep ends
on the sum of the radii of the colliding ob jects,
r
c
. We
take
r
c
= 1
R

b ecause these interactions involve a BH
and a star, and the former has a much smaller physi-
cal cross-section. For example, the Schwarzschild radius
of a 10
M

BH is only 30 km, or 4
:
31

10

5
R

. For
this reason, direct collisions b etween compact ob jects
are very rare and not included in our mo del.
We note that direct collisions b etween BHs, via GW
emission, were shown to b e ecient in nuclear star clus-
ters without SMBHs (e.g.,
 Portegies Zwart & McMil-
lan
 2000
;
 O'Leary et al.
 2006
;
 Ro driguez et al.
 2016
).
Howe ver, in the GN, star-BH collisions are much more
frequent than direct BH-BH c ollis ions . As depicted in
Figure
 1
, the star-BH collision timescale for a range
of density proles is many orders of magnitude shorter
than the BH-BH GW collision timesc ale (for the rele-
vant equations, see
 O'Leary et al.
 2009
;
 Gondan et al.
2018
, for example). Thus, we exp ect that star-BH col-
lisions will b e the main driver of IMBH growth in the
GN.
2.3.
Statistical Approach to Col lisions
We simulate the mass growth of a p opulation of BHs
with initial conditions detailed in Section
 2.1
. Over an
increment 
t
of 10
6
yr, we calculate the probability of
a collision o cc urring, given by 
t=t
coll
. This choice of

t
is motivated by our galactic center's star formation
timescale (e.g.,
 Lu et al.
 2009
), allowing for regular re-
plenishment of the stellar p opulation in the GN. We have
checked that the results are not sensitive to this choice
of 
t
, omitted here to avoid c lutter. We draw a numb er
b etween 0 and 1 using a random numb er generator. If
that numb er is less than or equal to the probability, we
increase the BH's mass by 
m
, the mass that the BH is
exp ected to accrete in a single collision (see Section
 2.4
for details). We recalculate the collision timescale using
the up dated BH mass and rep eat this pro cess until the
time elapsed equals the simulation time of 10 Gyr
3
.
3
Closer to the SMBH, 
t
may exceed the collision timescale by
a factor of a few for steep densi ty proles. We include a safe-
guard in our co de which takes the ratio
t
coll
=

t
and rounds it
to the nearest integer. We take this integer to b e the numb er of
collisions and increase the BH mass accordingly.

Mass Growth
When a BH collides w ith a star, it may accrete m a-
terial and grow in mass. The details of the accretion
dep end on the relative velo city b etween the BH and
star. For simplicity, this calculation assumes that the
two ob jects exp erience a he ad on collision, with the BH
passing through the star's center. We b egin by con-
sidering the escap e velo city from the B H at the star's
outermost p oint, its surface, which corresp onds to the
maximum impact parameter 1 R

. Qualitatively, one
might exp ect that the BH could accrete the entire star
(i.e., 
m
Ë˜
1 M

) if the relative velo city is smaller than
the escap e velo city from the BH at this p oint. However,
in the vicinity of the SMBH, the disp ersion velo city of
the stars may b e much larger than the escap e velo city
from the BH at the star's surface. In this case, the BH
accretes a \tunnel" of material through the star. This
tunnel has radius equal to the Bondi radius and length
approximately 1
R

.

start with identical p opulations of 10

BHs (grey)
and simulate growth through collisions using a statisti-
cal approach. As the BHs g row, the c ollis ion timescale,
which dep ends on



, however, the simula-
tions assume

= 1 for the ste llar density prole, ensur-
ing the collision timescale is long com pared to the sim-
ulation time, 10 Gyr. Therefore, the BHs grow slowly,

We consider an example that highlights the mass
growth as a function of distance from the SMBH. Grey dots
represent the initial masses and distances from the SMBH
of the BHs involved in the simulation. For simplicity, we set
the inital mass equal to 10
M

for all of the BHs. Assuming
the density prole of stars has

= 1, we consider two cases:
BHs accrete all of the star's mass during a collision (red) and
only a p ortion of the star's mass is accreted during a collision
given by Eq.

 (blue). The latter case results in less growth
closer to the SMB H where the velo city disp ersion b ecomes
high. The shaded regions and dashed lines represent the
analytical predictions detailed in Section

in which

This equation is plotted in Figure

(red) and 
m
from Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton
accretion (blue), and the curves coincide with the cor-
resp onding simulated res ults. The shaded regions rep-
resent one standard deviation from Eq. (
7
), calculated
using the square ro ot of the numb er of collisions,
T =t
coll
.
As indicated by the results in red, in the absence of
Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion, the BHs c losest to the
SMBH exp erience the most growth b ecause they have
shorter collision timesc ales. However, Bondi-Hoyle-
Lyttleton accretion b ecomes imp ortant closer to the
SMBH, where the velo city disp ersion is large compared
with the stars' escap e velo city, and c urtails the mass
growth for BHs in this region. Outside of 10

2
p c, a BH
consumes the star's entire mass: the accretion-limited

m
governed by Eq. (
7
) is greater than or equal to the
star's mass .
Eq.

collision timescale is shorter, corresp onding to a larger
index

in the density prole (see Figure

), the growth
IMBH Formation in Galactic Nuclei

sequently, while we can now assume 

circularize and shrink its orbit. We implement the ef-

IMBH growth
As detailed ab ove, BH-stellar collisions can increas e
the BH masses as a function of time. Here, we examine
the sensitivity of the BH growth to the density p ower
law. From Eq. (
1
), it is clear that the growth rate de-
p ends on the stellar density prole, governed by the in-
dex

. We exp ec t that higher values of

proles, will result in more ecient mass growth. In

Gravitational Wave Mergers and Intermediate
and Extreme Mass Ratio Inspiral Candidates
Towards the SMBH, ec ie nt collisions can create BHs
massive enough to m erge with the SMBH through GWs.
Following the metho d detailed in Section
 2.5
, when a
given BH meets the criterion
t
GW
< t
elapsed
, we mark
it as merged with the SMBH. We assume that at this
p oint the dynamics o f the BH will b e determined by GW
emission, shrinking and circularizing the BHs orbit un-
til it undergo es an extreme or intermediate mass ratio
inspiral (EMRI and IMRI, re sp ectively). The righthand
plot in Figure
 3
 shows the BH masses versus time of
merger. It is interesting to note that even in the ab-
sence of relaxation pro cesses, w hich are often invoked
to e xplain the formation of EMRIs, EMRIs and notably
IMRIs can form in this region.

Two Body Relaxation Processes
A BH orbiting the SMBH exp eriences weak gravita-
tional interactions with other ob jects in the GN. Over a
relaxation time, these interactions alter its orbit ab out
the SMBH. The two-b o dy relaxation timescale for a

timescale for a BH on a semi-circular orbit to change
its orbital energy and angular mom entum by order of
themselves. The BH exp eriences diusion in its angular
momentum and energy as a function of time (dep ending

Additionally, b ecause they are more massive on

p ected to segregate inwards in the GN (e.g.,

We incorp orate relaxation pro ces ses by intro ducing a
small change in the BH's energy and angular momen-
tum each time it orbits the SMBH. We apply a small

new orbital parameters can b e calculated following
 Lu
& Naoz
 (
2019
), and see Naoz et al. in prep for full set
of equations.
We ac count for the eects of relaxation pro cesses,
including mass-s egregation, using a multi-faceted ap-
proach. We b egin by migrating e ach BH towards the
center over its mass-segregation timescale, shifting it in-
crementally inward such that its orbital energy changes
by order of itself within the segregation timesc ale .
As the BHs segregate down the p otential well, the ir
abundance with resp ect to stars incre ases, until at some
turnover radius, BHs b ec ome the dom inant source of
scattering for b oth black holes and stars. Within this ra-
dius, BH self-interaction dominate s over two-b o dy scat-
terings with the now rarer main-sequence stars. The
BHs will then settle onto a Bahcall-Wolf prole , while
the stars may follow a shallower prole, with approx-
imately
n

/
r

:

, inwards of the trans ition radius
(Linial & Sari in prep.).
Therefore, after the initial mass segregation, we allow
the BHs to b egin diusing over a relaxation tim escale,
their orbital parameters changing slowly through a ran-
dom pro cess. In this random pro ces s, some of the BHs
may migrate closer to the SMBH. We terminate mass
growth when the BH enters the inner 200 au of the GN,
within which the density of stars is uncertain. This cut-
o is based on the 120 au p ericenter of S0-2, the closest
known s tar to the SMBH (e.g.,
 Ghez et al.
 2005
).
Another physical pro ce ss that causes inward migra-
tion is dynamical friction. A cursory derivation based
on the dynamical friction e quations describ ed in
 Binney
& Tremaine
 (
2008
) reveals the pro cess to have a simi-
lar timesc ale to mas s segregation. If a BH diuses to
a distance greater than 2 p c from the SMBH, exiting
the sphere of in
uence, we have it sink inwards, back
towards the center, over a dynamical friction tim escale.
After one dynamical friction timescale has passed, we
restart diusion.
We note that our prescription ignores self-interactions
b etween the BHs. As mentioned ab ove, as the BHs sink
towards the SMBH, the ir concentration in the inner re-
gion of the GN increases, allowing them to dominate the
scattering. We reserve the inclusion of these interactions
for future s tudy.
2.9.
Eect of Relaxation Processes
As depicted in Figure
 4
, two-b o dy relaxation pro ces ses
result in m ore EMRIs and IMRIs events. These pro-
cesses allow BHs that b egin furthe r from the SMBH
to migrate inwards and grow more eciently in mass.
Howe ver, it also im p edes the growth of BHs that are
initially closer to the SMBH by allowing them to dif-

Similar to Figure
 3
, we plot the initial masses versus initial distance (grey) and nal mass versus nal distance (red)
for 500 BHs. This simulation includes relaxation pro cesses, including mass segregation, diusion, and dynamical friction. We
assume

migration, BHs merge more quickly with the SMBH, b efore they can b ecome as massive as those in Figure

. Additionally, more
BHs b ecome EMRIs and IMRIs. Additionally, in the third panel, we show a histogram of the simulated IMBH masses for two
dierent values of

fuse out of the inner region where collisions are ecient.
As can b e seen in Figure

, the net result is that more
BHs grow, but the maximum mass is lower compared
to the s cenario that ignores two-b o dy relaxation. The
histogram in Figure

and a median of

, which lies within the mass gap.

DISCUSSION AND PREDICTIONS
We explore the feasibility of forming IMBHs in a
GN through s uccessive collisions b etween a stellar-mass
BH and main-sequence stars. Taking b oth a statisti-
cal and analytic approach, we show that this channel
can pro duce I MB Hs eciently with masses as high as
10
3

4
M

and may result in many IMBH-SMBH merg-
ers (intermediate-mass ratio inspiral, IMRIs) and EM-
RIs.
As the stellar mass BH c ollides with a star, the BH
will grow in mass. The increase may equal star's en-
tire mass if the relative velo city is smaller than the es-
cap e velo city from the BH at 1 R

. However, near the
SMBH, the velo city disp ersion may b e larger than the
escap e velo city from the BH at the star's radius. In this
limit, the BH accretes a \tunnel" of material through
the star, estimated using Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accre -
tion. In our statistical analysis, we acc ount fo r Bondi-
Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion and nd that BHs outside of
10

2
p c from the SMBH can accrete the entire star (see
Figure
 2
).
The eciency of collisions, and therefore IMBH,
EMRI, and IMRI formation as well, are sensitive to
the underlying stellar density. As shown in Figure
 3
, a
steep er density prole results in larger IMBHs. This b e-
havior can b e understo o d from the collision timescale's
dep endence on the stellar density prole. A steep er pro-
le yields shorter collision timescales near the SMBH.
Howe ver, the inclusion of relaxation pro c esses in the
simulations damp ens the in
uence of the stellar density
prole by allowing BHs to diuse into regions of more
or less ecient growth. As a result, more BHs grow in
mass, but their maximum mass is smaller (
Ë˜
10
4
M

).
Additionally, the nal masses have no apparent dep en-
dence on distance from the SMBH (see Figure
 4
).
Mass growth through BH-main-sequence star colli-
sions may act in concert with other IMBH formation
channels, such as compact ob ject binary mergers (e.g.,
Hoang et al.
 2018
;
 Stephan et al.
 2019
;
 Fragione et al.
2021
;
 Wang et al.
 2021
). While in some cases colli-
sions can unbind a binary (e.g.,
 Sigurdsson & Phinney
1993
;
 Fregeau et al.
 2004
), BH binaries can b e tightly
b ound e no ugh to withstand the collisions. Wide bina-
ries may als o b ecome unb ound due to interactions with
the neighb oring stars and compact ob jects (e.g.,
 Binney
& Tremaine
 1987
;
 Rose et al.
 2020
, see latter study for
the timescale for an arbitrary eccentricity). However,
as highlighted in previous studies, a substantial frac-
tion of these bina ries may merge due to the Eccentric
Kozai Lidov mechanism, leaving b ehind a single star or
a single compact ob ject (e.g.,
 Stephan et al.
 2016
,
 2019
;
Hoang et al.
 2018
). Additionally, to b e susceptible to
evap oration, BH binaries mus t have a wider congura-
tion. Otherwise, they will b e more tightly b ound that

the average kinetic e ne rgy of the surrounding ob jects,
and will only harden through weak gravitational inter-
actions with neighb oring stars (see for example Figure
6 in
 Rose et al.
 2020
).
Not included in this study, collisions b etween the BH
and other compact ob jec ts will increase the BH growth
rate. BH-BH mergers (e.g.,
 O'Leary et al.
 2009
;
 Fra-
gione et al.
 2021
) and even neutron s tar BH mergers
(e.g.,
 Hoang et al.
 2020
) b e come more likely as the BHs
increase in mass through stellar c ollisions. As a result,
the BH-BH collision timescale, discussed in Section
 2.2
,
will b ec ome relevant to our simulations, allowing the
BHs to grow through this channel in addition to stel-
lar collisions. Additionally, this compact ob ject mergers
result in GW recoil, which may have a large impact on
the dynamics (e.g.,
 Baibhav et al.
 2020
;
 Fragione et al.
2021
)
The BH's mass growth increases GW emission, which
dissipates energy from the orbit. Along with relaxation
pro cesses, GW emission causes BHs to sink towards the
SMBH and eventually undergo a merger. As a result,
the GN environme nt is conducive to the formation of
EMRIs and IMRIs. The GW emission from EMRIs and
IMRIs is exp ected to b e at mHz frequencies, making
them promising candidates for LISA to observe. While
the exact rate calc ulation is b eyond the scop e of this
study, the mechanism outline d here seems very promis-
ing.
Our res ults also suggest that IMBHs are likely to ex-
ists in many galactic nuclei, as well as within our own
galactic center. This im plic ation seems to b e consis -
tent with recent obse rvational and theoretical studies
(e.g.,
 Hansen & Milosavljevic
 2003
;
 Maillard et al.
 2004
;
Gurkan & R asio
 2005
;
 Gualandris & Merritt
 2009

2020a
;
 Zheng et al.
 2020
;
 Naoz et al.
 2020
;
 GRAVITY
Collab oration et al.
 2020
).
Lastly, the collisions b etween stellar mass B Hs and
stars may contribute to the x-ray emission from our
galactic centre (e.g.,
 Muno et al.
 2005
,
 2009
;
 Hailey et al.
2018
;
 Zhu et al.
 2018
;
 Cheng et al.
 2018
)
5
. These inter-
actions, in particular grazing collisions, may also result
in tidal disruption events (e.g.,
 Perets et al.
 2016
;
 Sam-
sing et al.
 2019
;
 Kremer et al.
 2021
). Thus, the pro cess
outlined here may pro duce electromagnetic signatures
in addition to GW mergers.
