ABSTRACT
We repor t on a search for persistent radio emission from the one-o˙ Fast Radio Burst (FRB)
20190714A, as well as from two repeating FRBs, 20190711A and 20171019A, using the
MeerKAT radio telescope. For FRB 20171019A we also conducted simultaneous obser vations
with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) in ver y high energy gamma rays and
searched for signals in the ultraviolet, optical, and X-ray bands. For this FRB, we obtain a UV

20190714A, and is only the third known FRB to have such an association. Given the possible
association of a faint persistent source, FRB 20190714A may potentially be a repeating FRB
whose age lies between that of FRB 20121102A and FRB 20180916A. A parallel search for
repeat bursts from these FRBs revealed no new detections down to a ˛uence of 0.08 Jy ms for
a 1 ms duration burst.

1 INTRODUCTION
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are luminous transients that last for mi-
croseconds to milliseconds and occur at extragalactic to cosmo-
logical distances (e.g.
 Lor imer et al.
 2007
;
 Thor nton et al.
 2013
;
Macquar t et al.
 2020
). The estimated high radio luminosities and
associated br ightness temperatures required to produce these shor t-
timescale energetic events at such distances are what makes them
intr iguing (
Petro˙ et al.
 2021
;
 Caleb & Keane
 2021
). They have been
obser ved to emit from
˘
110 MHz

8 GHz
, though not yet across
a wide and continuous frequency band due to the var iable band-
limited spectra of the single pulses. Over 600 FRBs have been dis-
covered
1
of which
˘
20
have been seen to repeat, and it is presently
uncer tain whether they all do (
Caleb et al.
 2019
;
 James et al.
 2020
).
The extraordinar y obser ved character istics of the repeating and non-
repeating FRBs have led to var ious progenitor models with the bulk
of them favour ing neutron stars. Progenitor theor ies include binar y
neutron star mergers and collisions (
Totani
 2013
;
 Yamasaki et al.
2018
), giant pulses from extragalactic pulsars (
Cordes & Wasser-
man
 2016
;
 Popov & Pshirkov
 2016
), hyper ˛ares and giant ˛ares
from magnetars (
Popov & Postnov
 2013
;
 Popov et al.
 2018
), binar y
white dwar f mergers (
Kashiyama et al.
 2013
), neutron star comb-
ing" (
Zhang
 2018
) and interactions of neutron stars with active
galactic nuclei (
Vieyro et al.
 2017
) (see
 Platts et al.
 (
2019
) for a list
of potential progenitors). Some of these models predict radio after-
glows accompanying an FRB with timescales of days to years.
 Liu
et al.
 (
2016
) propose that the merger of a Ker r-Newman black hole
binar y is one of the plausible central engines for FRBs and their
afterglows.
 Dai et al.
 (
2017
), however, suggest that the persistent
emission is due to an ultra-relativistic pulsar wind nebula sweeping
up its ambient medium with FRBs repeatedly produced through one
of several potential mechanisms. In the magnetar model by
 Margalit
et al.
 (
2019
), FRBs produced by binar y neutron star mergers and
accretion induced collapse are expected to be accompanied by per-
sistent radio continuum emission on timescales of months to years.

The persistent emission is powered by the nebula of relativistic elec-
trons and magnetic ˝elds in˛ated by the magnetar ˛ares (
Margalit
et al.
 2019
). The existence of persistent emission associated with
FRBs could provide vital clues to their or igin. Moreover, potential
candidates and models for FRB progenitors predict counter par ts
in the X-ray an TeV bands. For example, a model by
 Lyubarsky
(
2014
) predicts millisecond outbursts of TeV emission accompany-
ing FRBs from magnetars. In 2020, FRB 20200428 was discovered
for the ˝rst time from a galactic magnetar, SGR 1935+2154. Fur-
ther more, an X-ray counter par t to this FRB was deteced for the ˝rst
time by several instr uments (
Tavani et al.
 2021
;
 Ridnaia et al.
 2021
;
Mereghetti et al.
 2020
;
 Insight-HXMT
 2020
).
Of the 19 FRBs that have been associated with host galax-
ies

) by the Australian
SKA Path˝nder (ASKAP) telescope did not yield persistent radio
continuum emission from the host galaxies (
Bhandar i et al.
 2020
).
Australian Telescope Compact Ar ray (ATCA) obser vations of FRBs
20180924B, 20181112A, 20190102C and 20190608B were con-
ducted at a centre frequency of 6.5 GHz. No persistent emission as
luminous as the one associated with FRB 20121102A was detected
for the ASKAP FRBs (
Bhandar i et al.
 2020
). While the tr ue age of
FRB 121102A is unknown, models based on polar ization studies
predict the age to be
˘
6

17
years (
Hilmarsson et al.
 2021
). It is
possible that younger, more active FRBs like FRB 20121102A are
associated with persistent radio emission while the emission might
have faded over time for the older ones. The possibility of repeating
FRBs not being so uncommon after all (
Ravi
 2019
) along with the
increasing arcsecond localisations suggests that we are enter ing an
era where we can begin to look for evidence of multiple classes by
studying FRB host galaxies and multi-wavelength counter par ts.
In this paper, we repor t on the search for persistent radio emis-
sion in the host galaxies of one apparent one-o˙ source (FRB
20190714A) and two repeating sources (FRBs 20171019A and
20190711A) (
Kumar et al.
 2019
,
 2021
) using MeerKAT. In case
of the latter, we also conducted simultaneous obser vations with the
High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) in ver y high energy
gamma rays. In addition, we searched for signals in the ultraviolet,
optical, and X-ray bands. The paper is str uctured as follows. In Sec-
tion
 2
, we discuss our obser vations and data reduction; in Section
 3
,
we discuss the single radio continuum detection and der ived multi-
wavelength upper limits. Our discussion and conclusions follow in
Section
 4
 and
 5
.
2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION
2.1 MeerKAT observations
The MeerKAT 64-parabolic-dish ar ray (
Jonas & MeerKAT Team
2016
;
 Mauch et al.
 2020
) is located in the Nor ther n Karoo deser t
near Car nar von, South Afr ica. Each o˙set Gregor ian" parabolic
dish antenna has an e˙ective diameter of 13.5 m. The inner core of
the ar ray contains 48 of the 64 dishes in a 1 km radius, while the
remaining 16 dishes are spread outward up to 8 km. The shor test and
longest baselines of the MeerKAT ar ray are 29 m and 8 km, respec-
tively, providing angular scales of 5
0 0
to 27
0
at the central frequency,
of the L -band receiver used here, of 1283 MHz. Multi-epoch ob-
ser vations of the FRB ˝elds were conducted with the MeerKAT
ar ray (Project ID: SCI-20190418-VC-01) at L -band (856 MHz to
1712 MHz). Details of the MeerKAT obser vations are presented
in Table
 1
. Only Stokes I (total intensity) of the MeerKAT ob-
ser vations are considered in this paper. The data cor relation was
done with the SKARAB cor relator (
Hickish et al.
 2016
) in 4k mode
which gives 4096 channels across the 856 MHz bandwidth resulting
in a frequency resolution of
˘
209 kHz. The data were reduced us-
ing the semi-automated MeerKAT data analysis pipelines -
> G : 0 C
3
(
Heywood
 2020
).
2.1.1 Imaging analysis
The
> G : 0 C
pipeline employs a collection of publicly available ra-
dio inter ferometr y data reduction software. The ˝nal data prod-
3
https://ascl.net/code/v/2627
ucts, including reduced and calibrated visibility data (including
self-calibration), continuum (including sub-band) images as well
as diagnostic plots, are provided by the pipeline. The customar y
con˝guration of the
> G : 0 C
pipeline incor porates ˛agging, cross-
calibration and self-calibration processes. In the ˛agging process,
the low-gain bandpass edges (856 MHz to 880 MHz and 1658 MHz
to 1800 MHz) are ˛agged on all baselines, along with the location of
the Galactic neutral hydrogen line at 1419.8 MHz to 1421.3 MHz.
Several other radio frequency inter ference (RFI) prone regions of
the spectr um are then ˛agged on baselines shor ter than 600 m.
Then, other possible RFI a˙ected data are ˛agged out using the
CASA routines r ˛ag and tfcrop for the calibrators, and using the
tr icolour package for the target ˝elds.
The cross-calibration steps using
> G : 0 C
were standard, includ-
ing setting the ˛ux scale and der iving cor rections for residual delay
calibration, bandpass and time-var ying gain. The
> G : 0 C
pipeline
uses the customar y tasks from the CASA (
McMullin et al.
 2007
)
suite for cross-calibration. After applying all the cor rections to the
target ˝eld, we channel-averaged the dataset by a factor of ˝ve chan-
nels before splitting out the science target. This is consistent with our
science goals, since the relic sources we target are in the central par ts
of our ˝elds, reducing the e˙ect of smear ing through the channel
averaging. To deconvolve and image the target data, the WSClean
imager (
O˙r inga et al.
 2014
) was used, with the multiscale and
wideband deconvolution algor ithms enabled to better allow imag-
ing of the di˙use emission present in the our ˝elds. Deconvolution
was per for med in ten sub-band images of each 82 MHz wide-band.
WSClean generates the multi-frequency synthesis (MFS) map, in
joined-channel deconvolution mode, with a central frequency of
1283 MHz. In other words, the MFS map is a full bandwidth map.
In WSClean, each of the sub-bands is deconvolved separately with
an initially high mask of 20
f
r ms
(using the auto masking function
provided by WSClean), to generate an ar tefact-free model of the
target ˝eld for the self-calibration process. This masking threshold
was iteratively reduced to a value of 3
f
r ms
in the ˝nal iteration
of imaging. The
> G : 0 C
pipeline uses the customar y tasks from the
Cubical software (
Kenyon et al.
 2018
) for self-calibration.
2.1.2 Single pulse searches
In addition to obtaining cor related data, the output data stream of
the F-engine are captured, delay cor rected, phased and channelised
before being sent over the central beamfor ming network to the beam-
for ming User Supplied Equipment (FBFUSE) that was designed and
developed at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn.
For this project, FBFUSE combined the data into 764 total-intensity
tied-ar ray beams which were used to populate the pr imar y beam of
˘
1
deg
2
of the ar ray. The data are then captured at 306.24

s time
resolution by the Transient User Supplied Equipment (TUSE), a
real-time transient detection backend instr ument developed by the
MeerTRAP
4
team at the University of Manchester. More details on
TUSE will be presented in an upcoming paper (Stappers et al. in
prep). The GPU-based single pulse search pipeline AstroAcceler-

2.2 e-MERLIN Observations
To constrain the position of the persistent continuum emission
associated with FRB 20190714A, we conducted L -band (centre
frequency of 1.51 GHz) obser vations of the target with the en-
hanced Multi-Element Remote-Linked Inter ferometer Network, e-
MERLIN ar ray in the United Kingdom (project code: CY10003)
on 13 Januar y, 2021 (see Section

2.3 The
Swift
satellite: UVOT and XRT observations
Neil Gehrels Swift Obser vator y (
Swif t
) is a multi-wavelength NASA
space mission operating in soft-X-rays and optical/UV. Here we
use data from the X-ray Telescope (XRT) (
Bur rows et al.
 2005
)
which operates in the soft X-ray domain of
0
Ł
3

10
keV as well as
data taken by the UV/Optical Telescope (UVOT) (
Roming et al.
2005
) operating in the UV to optical domain (
170

600
nm).
Dur ing the FRB 20171019A multi-wavelength (MWL) obser ving
campaign, two 2 ks target-of-oppor tunity (ToO) obser vations were
per for med with
Swif t
from 2019-09-28 18:37:02 to 2019-09-28
21:52:54 and 2019-10-18 18:03:00 to 2019-10-18 20:03:00 on the
FRB 20171019A localisation region. Simultaneously with Swift-
XRT, ˝ve UVOT images were taken with the UVM2 ˝lter (central
wavelengh = 2246 Å) over the 2 epochs with a total exposure of 4 ks.
The images are aspect-cor rected and summed with the
uvotimsum
tool (
HEASOFT 6.26
). Obser vations were per for med with Swift-
XRT in the standard Photon Counting obser ving mode (PC). The
XRT PC data are processed with
xrtpipeline
(
HEASOFT 6.26
).
A summed image is extracted with
xselect
.
2.4 Very-high energy gamma-ray observations with H.E.S.S.
Obser vations of FRB 20171019A were also obtained in the ver y-
high energy gamma-ray domain with the H.E.S.S. imaging atmo-
spher ic Cherenkov telescope ar ray, sensitive in the range between a
few tens of GeVs and 100 TeV. H.E.S.S. is located on the Khomas

at an elevation of
˘
1800 m above sea level. Obser vations took place
contemporaneously to the ˝rst epoch of MeerKAT obser vations of
FRB 20171019A descr ibed above. The data set was obtained with
the H.E.S.S. phase II ar ray, including the upg raded 12 m-diameter
CT1-4 telescopes (
Ashton et al.
 2020
) and the large 28 m-diameter
6
https://github.com/e- merlin/eMERLIN_CASA_pipeline
CT5 telescope (
Bolmont et al.
 2014
). A standard data quality selec-
tion was applied to the data (
Aharonian et al.
 2006
). The events have
then been selected and their direction and energy reconstr ucted us-
ing a log-likelihood minimization compar ing the recorded shower
images of all tr iggered telescopes (requir ing at least two telescopes
to see the same gamma-ray event) to a semi-analytical model of air
showers (
de Naurois & Rolland
 2009
).
We de˝ne a circular region-of-interest centered on the position
of FRB 20171019A with a radius of 0.12

, optimal for a point-like
source of emission as expected from FRB 20171019A. The back-
g round level in this ON region was deter mined using the standard
r ing backg round technique (
Berge et al.
 2007
) based on a radially
symmetr ic r ing around the source position. This technique allows us
to der ive the backg round level from the same ˝eld of view and as-
sures that the gamma-ray signal and backg round are estimated with
the same acceptance and under the same obser vation conditions.

. The typical

,
which is 2.5 times the expected theoretical r ms. The wideband MFS
image does not allow pr imar y beam cor rection procedure as this can
only be done on the sub-band images with limited r ms for detection
of the sources. However, our sources are the phase centres of our
˝elds and thus una˙ected by the e˙ect of the pr imar y beam.
Due to the lack of MeerKAT pr imar y beam cor rection, we
did not compare the ˛ux densities of the discrete sources with
their NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Obser vator y) VLA (Ver y
Large Ar ray) Sky Sur vey (NVSS) counter par ts. However, Chibueze
et al. (2021, submitted) con˝r med that the overall ˛ux densities
obtained with MeerKAT and NVSS are in good ag reement with
each other within er rors of
˘
5
%. We compared the astrometr y of
the discrete radio sources obtained with MeerKAT and NVSS in
Figure
 1
. The position uncer tainty of the MeerKAT ranges from
0
Ł
0 0
2 (close to the centre of the pr imar y beam) to a few arcseconds
towards the edge of the pr imar y beam. The scatter obser ved in
Figure
 1
 is mostly due to the probability of the centroids of emission
in the
˘
45
0 0
NVSS resolution being di˙erent from the centroids at
MeerKAT's resolution and par tly due to higher position uncer tainty
of the fainter sources. Therefore, we conclude that our MeerKAT
data are well calibrated and the ˛ux density and astrometr y are as
accurate as the er rors indicate.
3.1.1 Looking for persistent continuum emission associated with
the FRB ˝elds

uncer tainty of (0.04, 0.16) arcsec in R.A. and Dec., respectively.
The o˙set from the FRB position is negligible in R.A. and 1.2

is possibly higher due to the low declination of the phase-reference
source and to the strong RFI which were removed from the data
but may have a˙ected the linear ity of the receiver response. The

We estimate the probability of a chance alignment of a back-
g round persistent radio source and the host galaxy, following the
procedure of
 Eftekhar i et al.
 (
2018
). Instead of using the FRB lo-
calisation region, we use the area of the galaxy, which is taken as
2
0 0

2
0 0
, twice the half light radius from
 Heintz et al.
 (
2020
). Given
the source has a ˛ux density of
˘
90
`
Jy we estimate the chance
alignment probability of 0.0008, which cor responds to 3.4
f
. The
˛ux density threshold, assuming 3
f
, for an unresolved radio source
is
˘
15
`
Jy. If instead we consider the probability of detecting any
radio source above our ˛ux density threshold of
15
`
Jy, the probabil-
ity of a chance alignment is, therefore, approximately 0.8%, making
the statistical signi˝cance of our detection 2.6
f
. This represents the
˝rst detection of radio continuum emission associated with the host
(galaxy) of FRB 20190714A (see Figure

 and

3.1.3 MeerKAT non-detections
No continuum emission was detected near FRBs 20171019A and
20190711A. As each of the images of these sources has an r ms
of

associated with FRBs 20171019A and 20190711A will be

No new FRBs or repeat bursts from the known FRBs were detected
above a ˛uence threshold of 0.08 Jy ms assuming a 1 ms duration
burst.

Swift
The UVOT summed image is presented in Figure
 4
. The UVOT
˝eld of view cor responds roughly to the uncer tainty
7
of the locali-
sation region of FRB 20171019A (RA = 7.5
0
and DEC = 7
0
). Using
uvotdetect
, we ˝nd 30 sources above the
5
f
level and within the
FRB 20171019A uncer tainty region. Using a 3 arcsec maximum
separation, which is slightly larger than the UVOT PSF (
Breeveld
et al.
 2010
), these sources are cross-matched with known catalogue
sources. We ˝nd that out of the 30 sources detected by UVOT, 28
are spatially coincident with stars catalogued in the SDSS catalogue
(DR12;
 Alam et al.
 2015
), and one source is coincident with a galaxy
(AGN broadline SDSS ID: 1237652599570890948 at

0

).
This galaxy is also detected by the MeerKAT radio obser vations. We
use the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED)
8
to search for
known galaxies in the FRB 20171019A uncer tainty regions. We ˝nd
multiple galaxies with unknown redshifts, therefore we cannot draw
conclusions on the host galaxy from our obser vations. Using a 50
0 0
circular ON region centred on the position of FRB 20171019A and
a 50
0 0
OFF region that does not contain any of the detected sources,
we r un the

No signi˝cant gamma-ray excess above the expected backg round
is detected from the direction of FRB 20171019A, with 52 gamma
candidate events from the source region and 524 backg round event.
A second analysis using an independent event calibration and recon-
str uction (
Parsons & Hinton
 2014
) con˝r ms this result. A search for
var iable emission on timescales ranging from milliseconds to sev-
eral minutes with tools provided in (
Br un et al.
 2020
) does not reveal
any var iability above 2.2
f
. For the total data set of 1.8 h, 95% con˝-
dence level (C. L.) upper limits on the photon ˛ux are der ived using
the method descr ibed by
 Rolke et al.
 (
2005
). The energy threshold
of the data is highly dependent on the zenith angle of the obser va-
tions. For these obser vations, the zenith angles range from 15 to 25

4 DISCUSSION
Of the targeted FRB ˝elds repor ted here, only FRB 20190714A
is obser ved to be spatially coincident with a persistent radio con-
tinuum source. We obtain an upper limit of
˘
15
`
Jy beam

1
for
FRBs 20190711A and 20171019A, respectively, and a peak inten-
sity of
˘
53
`
Jy beam

1
for the emission coincident with FRB
20190714A. This source is detected at both epochs with similar
intensities within the measured r ms of the images (see Tables
 1
 and
2
 for details). The values in the Table
 2
 are der ived by car r ying
out 2D Gaussian ˝t using similar ellipses enclosing the detected
persistent emission. The average ˛ux density is
˘
3
times less than
that of the persistent source associated with FRBs 20121102A, one
of the most proli˝c repeaters, located at
I
=
0
Ł
19273
¹
8
º
. Persistent
radio emission from FRB 20201124A was detected by the uGMRT
(
Whar ton et al.
 2021
) and the JVLA (
Ricci et al.
 2021
) on angular
scales of a few arcseconds. However, it is resolved out at scales of
˘
0
Ł
1
arcseconds with the European VLBI Network (
Marcote et al.
2021
) suggesting that it is not a compact source directly associated
with the FRB. In contrast, the other localised, proli˝c repeating
FRB 20180916A has no persistent radio counter par t.
In the image in Figure
 3
 one can see that the persistent radio
source lies at the edge of the optical extent of the host galaxy
as seen in PanSTARRS obser vations (
Heintz et al.
 2020
). Our
der ived 1283 MHz peak position with MeerKAT places it just

large o˙set from the centre of the galaxy makes the persistent source
unlikely to be an AGN. So far this FRB has not been seen to repeat.
Higher resolution imaging will be required to be cer tain of a direct
association of the persistent source with the FRB. We did not have
su˚cient sensitivity in the sub-band images, thus, we are unable to
der ive the spectral index of the emission of the host galaxy.

650 MHz with a ˛ux density of

`
Jy (
Whar ton et al.

),
while the JVLA detected persistent emission with a ˛ux density of
340

30
`
Jy at 3 GHz (
Ricci et al.
 2021
). Assuming the estimated
spectral index between these frequencies (
˘ 
0
Ł
5
,
 Ricci et al.
 2021
),
the 1.3 GHz ˛ux density would be
˘
500
`
Jy (similar to the 3-
f
upper limit on obser vations from
1

2
GHz;
 Law et al.
 2021
). The
˛ux density we measured for FRB 20190714A is a factor of
˘
10
lower than FRB20201124A, but FRB 20190714A is also a factor
2.6 more distant. Therefore, the ˛ux densities would be comparable
if they were at similar distances.
Given the resolution of MeerKAT we are unable to de˝ni-
tively state whether the persistent emission is associated with a
star-for ming region or the FRB itself. However, the increased reso-
lution with the e-MERLIN baselines would tend to favour a compact
source similar to the one obser ved in FRB 20121102A. One of the
leading models to explain the bursts from, and radio counter par t
to FRB 20121102A, is a young nebula powered ˛ar ing magnetar
embedded in a 2050 year-old super nova remnant (
Beloborodov
2017
;
 Metzger et al.
 2019
). The lack of a br ight persistent radio
source associated with the repeater FRB 20180916A suggests that
it is comparatively older at
&
200

500
years and the persistent
radio source may have faded. In the model by
 Metzger et al.
 (
2019
),
the nebula is suggested to contr ibute signi˝cantly to the rotation
measure and dispersion measure (DM), as well as to the persis-
tent radio luminosity. These values are expected to decrease on a
timescale of a few decades to centur ies. Given the association of a
comparatively fainter persistent source, FRB 20190714A may po-
tentially be a repeating FRB whose age lies between that of FRB
20121102A and FRB 20180916A. Millisecond magnetars for med
through standard astrophysical channels such as hydrogen poor su-
perluminous super novae and long duration gamma-ray bursts are
consistent with the progenitors of FRBs expected in low-metallicity
dwar f galaxies with high speci˝c star-for mation rate such as for
FRB 20121102A. However,
 Margalit et al.
 (
2019
) note that it is also
possible to for m such sources through a var iety of channels, includ-
ing binar y neutron star mergers and accretion induced collapse of
white dwar fs in environments and host galaxy demog raphics di˙er-
ent to FRB 20121102A. Such suggestions are consistent with recent
localisations (e.g.
 Heintz et al.
 2020
).
The X-ray and VHE obser vations with
Swif t
and H.E.S.S.
allows us to probe non-ther mal persistent emission associated to
the FRB host galaxy or its source. Recently, H.E.S.S. obser ved

magnetar linked to a repeating FRB and its ˝rst X-ray counter par t.
Magnetar X-ray ˛ares could in fact be non-ther mal in nature (
Li et al.
2021
) indicating the presence of par ticle acceleration that could po-
tentially reach the VHE domain. The inverse Compton process is a
pr imar y candidate for the production of VHE non-ther mal emission.
H.E.S.S. obser vations did not lead to a detection of a persistent or a
transient source associated to FRB 20171019A. We found no X-ray
counter par ts and thus der ived the upper limits to constrain these

emissions. In the case of existence of X-ray non-ther mal outbursts,
the lack of VHE detection could indicate that inverse Compton is
weak in the vicinity of the magnetars or that the VHE gamma-ray
emission is quenched. This latter scenar io could be explained by the
fact that inverse Compton is taking place too close to the magne-
tar's sur face, where pair production and photon splitting could be
responsible for signi˝cant energy losses (
Hu et al.
 2019
), preventing
energetic par ticles and photons to reach the nebula.
No persistent emissions were detected towards FRB
20190711A and FRB 20171019A in our MeerKAT obser vations
(see Figures
 7
,
 8
, and
 9
), therefore no follow up obser vations were
conducted towards those FRBs.
5 CONCLUSIONS
Several FRB models envision persistent emission to be associated
with these sources. In this paper, we conducted radio obser vations
of three FRBs (FRB 20190714A, 20190711A and 20171019A),
and also a multi-wavelength campaign on one of these (FRB
20171019A).
We detected persistent compact radio emission associated with
FRB 20190714A (at
I
=
0
Ł
2365
) using the MeerKAT and e-
MERLIN radio telescope. This represents the ˝rst detection of the
radio continuum emission associated with the host (galaxy) of FRB
20190714A and is only the third known FRB to have such an as-
sociation. We fur ther more obtained a radio upper limit of
˘
15
`
Jy
beam

for the repeating FRBs 20190711A and 20171019A.
We also per for med UV, X-ray and VHE obser vations with the
Swif t
and H.E.S.S. instr uments and obtained upper limits in the three
domains constraining the MWL emissions from FRB 20171019A.
The search for FRB MWL counter par ts is ongoing within the
H.E.S.S. collaboration and more results will be published in fu-
ture works.
Given the association of a comparatively fainter persistent
source, FRB 20190714A may potentially be a repeating FRB whose
age lies between that of FRB 20121102A and FRB 20180916A.
