Abstract
We present a model of the Cassini state of Mercury that comprises an inner core, a uid core
and a mantle. Our model includes inertial and gravitational torques between interior regions,
and viscous and electromagnetic (EM) coupling at the boundaries of the uid core. We show
that the coupling between Mercury's interior regions is suciently strong that the obliquity of
the mantle spin axis deviates from that of a rigid planet by no more than 0.01 arcmin. The man-
tle obliquity decreases with increasing inner core size, but the change between a large and no
inner core is limited to 0.015 arcmin. EM coupling is stronger than viscous coupling at the in-
ner core boundary and, if the core magnetic eld strength is above 0.3 mT, locks the uid and
solid cores into a common precession motion. Because of the strong gravitational coupling be-
tween the mantle and inner core, the larger the inner core is, the more this co-precessing core
is brought into an alignment with the mantle, and the more the obliquity of the polar moment
of inertia approaches that expected for a rigid planet. The misalignment between the polar mo-
ment of inertia and mantle spin axis increases with inner core size, but is limited to 0.007 ar-
cmin. Our results imply that the measured obliquities of the mantle spin axis and polar mo-
ment of inertia should coincide at the present-day level of measurement errors, and cannot be
distinguished from the obliquity of a rigid planet.
Plain language summary:
The plane of Mercury's orbit around the Sun is slowly precess-
ing about an axis xed in space. This entrains a precession of the spin axis of Mercury at the
same rate, an equilibrium known as a Cassini state. The angle between the spin axis and the
normal to the orbital plane is known as the obliquity and remains xed. Observations have con-
rmed that Mercury's obliquity matches, within measurement errors, the theoretical predic-
tion based on an entirely rigid planet. However, we know that Mercury has a large metallic core
which is liquid, although the central part may be solid. In this work, we investigate how the
presence of a uid and solid core aect the Cassini state of Mercury. We show that the inter-
nal coupling between the solid core, uid core and the mantle is suciently strong that the obliq-
uity of the mantle does not depart from that of a rigid planet by more than 0.01 arcmin, an
oset smaller than the present-day error in measurements. We also show that the larger the
solid inner core is, the more the planet behaves as if it were precessing as an entirely rigid body.
1 Introduction
Mercury is expected to be in a Cassini state (Figure 1) whereby its orbit normal and spin-
symmetry axis are both coplanar with, and precess about, the normal to the Laplace plane [
Colombo
,
1966;
Peale
, 1969, 2006]. The orientation of the Laplace plane varies on long timescales, but
its present-day orientation can be reconstructed from ephemerides data [
Yseboodt and Margot
,
2006;
Baland et al.
, 2017]. Likewise, the rate of precession is also not observed directly, but is
reconstructed by ephemerides data. The latest estimate is a retrograde precession period of 325,513
yr with an inclination angle of
I
= 8
:
5330

between the orbit and Laplace plane normals [
Ba-
land et al.
, 2017]. Measurements of the obliquity
"
m
, dened as the angle of misalignment be-
tween the spin-symmetry axis and the orbit normal, have been obtained by dierent techniques,
including ground based radar observations [
Margot et al.
, 2007, 2012], and stereo digital ter-
rain images [
Stark et al.
, 2015a] and radio tracking data [

, 2016;
Genova et al.
, 2019;
Konopliv et al.
, 2020] from the MErcury Surface Space ENvi-
ronment GEochemistry and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft. Within measurement errors,
all techniques yield an obliquity which is coplanar with the orbit and Laplace plane normals
and consistent with a Cassini state. Furthermore, the observed obliquity angle (2

The prediction of Mercury's obliquity is based on the assumption that the whole planet
precesses as a single body. However, we know that Mercury has a uid core from two main lines
of evidence. First, Mercury's large scale magnetic eld is intrinsic, and must be maintained by
dynamo action [
Anderson et al.
, 2011, 2012;
Johnson et al.
, 2012]. This requires uid motion
in its metallic core, and hence that Mercury's core is at least partially liquid. Second, the ob-
served amplitude of the 88-day longitudinal libration is approximately twice as large as that
expected if Mercury were librating as a rigid body [
Margot et al.
, 2007, 2012;
Stark et al.
, 2015a].
This indicates that it is only the mantle that librates, and that the outer part of the core is uid.
These evidences do not necessarily imply that the whole of Mercury's core is uid, but only that
its outermost part must be. A solid inner core may have nucleated at the centre although its
size is not well constrained. Inner core growth leads to planetary contraction, and the inferred
radial contraction of
˘
7 km since the late heavy bombardment [
Byrne et al.
, 2014] places an
approximate limit of 800 km on the inner core radius [
Grott et al.
, 2011]. However, the inner
core could be larger if a signicant fraction of its growth occurred earlier in Mercury's history.

With a uid core, and possibly a solid inner core, the observed obliquity
"
m
reects the
orientation of the spin-symmetry axis of the precessing mantle and crust alone. Neglecting dis-
sipation, and at equilibrium in the Cassini state, the spin axis of the uid core and the spin-
symmetry axis of the inner core should both also precess about the normal to the Laplace plane
in a retrograde direction with a period of 325,513 yr. Both of these axes should also lie in the
plane that denes the equilibrium Cassini state [e.g.
Dumberry and Wieczorek
, 2016], although
their obliquity angles may be dierent than
"
m
. Whether the spin axis of the uid core is brought
into an alignment with the mantle obliquity depends primarily on the pressure torque (also re-
ferred to as the inertial torque) exerted by the centrifugal force of the rotating uid core on the
misaligned elliptical shape of the core-mantle boundary (CMB) [
Poincare
, 1910]. The more at-
tened the CMB is, the stronger the pressure torque is, and the more the uid core is entrained
into a co-precession at a similar obliquity to that of the mantle. The attening of Mercury's
CMB is not known. But if one assumes that the topography of the CMB coincides with an equipo-
tential surface at hydrostatic equilibrium with the imposed frozen-in mass anomalies in the up-
per mantle and crust, then the pressure torque at the CMB is sucient to bring the uid core
into a close alignment with the mantle [
Peale et al.
, 2014]. The spin axis of the uid core is not
expected to be exactly aligned with the spin-symmetry axis of the mantle, but suciently close
that the resulting mantle obliquity does not dier much from that of a single body planet. Fur-
thermore, viscous and electromagnetic (EM) coupling at the CMB can further restrict the mis-
alignment between the mantle and core [
Peale et al.
, 2014].
If an inner core is present, its obliquity angle is determined by the sum of the torques act-
ing on it. This includes the gravitational torque from the Sun acting on its tilted gure, anal-
ogous to the torque applied on the tilted mantle that sets the obliquity
"
m
. In addition, the
tilt of the inner core also depends on the gravitational torque imposed by the mantle and the
pressure torque at the inner core boundary (ICB) imposed by the uid core. If the mantle grav-
itational torque dominates, the inner core tilt is expected to remain closely aligned with the
mantle. Conversely, if the pressure torque at the ICB is the largest, the inner core should in-
stead be closely aligned with the spin axis of the uid core. A strong viscous and/or EM cou-
pling at the ICB should also enforce a closer alignment between the rotation vectors of the in-
ner core and uid core.
It is on the basis of the observed mantle obliquity that the polar moment of inertia of Mer-
cury is inferred [e.g.
Peale
, 1976;
Margot et al.
, 2018]. Inherent in this calculation is the built-
in assumption that the mantle obliquity does not deviate from that of a rigid planet by a sub-
stantial amount. However, the recent study by
Peale et al.
[2016] suggests that the inner core
can be misaligned from the mantle by a few arcmin and that a large inner core can perturb the
orientation of the spin vector of the mantle by as much as 0.1 arcmin. This challenges the as-
sumption that the observed obliquity reects the orientation of the whole planet.
Furthermore, if a large inner core is misaligned with the mantle, then the mantle spin axis
does not coincide with the orientation of the polar moment of inertia of the whole planet. This
can introduce a systematic oset between dierent types of obliquity measurements. Those based
on tracking topographic features [
Margot et al.
, 2007, 2012;
Stark et al.
, 2015a] capture the obliq-
uity of the mantle spin axis. While those based on the orientation of the gravity eld [
Mazarico
et al.
, 2014;
Verma and Margot
, 2016;
Genova et al.
, 2019;
Konopliv et al.
, 2020] are instead
tied to the orientation of the principal moment of inertia of the whole planet. An oset of the
obliquity of the mantle spin axis with respect to the gravity eld could be used to constrain the
size of the inner core, even though this is dicult to do at present because the dierent esti-
mates of the obliquity of the gravity eld do not match well with one another.

There is thus a signicant interest in properly assessing how the presence of a solid in-
ner core at the centre of Mercury may aect its Cassini state equilibrium. Here, we present a
model of Mercury's Cassini state that comprises a uid core and solid inner core. The model
is an adaptation of a similar model developed to study the Cassini state of the Moon [
Dumb-
erry and Wieczorek
, 2016;
Stys and Dumberry
, 2018;
Organowski and Dumberry
, 2020]. The
specic questions that motivate our study are the following. First, we want to determine how
large the misaligned obliquities of the uid core and solid inner core can be and how they de-
pend on model parameters. Second, we want to assess by how much the mantle obliquity may
dier from that of an entirely rigid Mercury, and third, by how much the obliquities of the spin-
symmetry axis of the mantle and gravity eld may dier.
2 Theory
2.1 The interior structure of Mercury
Our model of Mercury consists of four layers of uniform density: a solid inner core, a uid
outer core, a solid mantle, and a thin crust. The outer radii of each of these layers, are denoted
by
r
s
,
r
f
,
r
m
, and
R
, and their densities by
ˆ
s
,
ˆ
f
,
ˆ
m
, and
ˆ
c
, respectively. The inner core ra-
dius
r
s
corresponds to the ICB radius, the uid core radius
r
f
to the CMB radius, and
R
=
2439
:
36 km to the planetary radius of Mercury. Compressibility eects from increasing pres-
sure with depth are not negligible in the core of Mercury. However adopting uniform densities
simplies the analytical expressions of the model while still capturing the rst order rotational
dynamics. Uniform densities were also adopted by
Peale et al.
[2016] and following the same
strategy facilitates comparisons between our results.
We build our interior model as detailed in
Peale et al.
[2016]. We rst specify
r
s
,
ˆ
s
(or
a density contrast at the ICB), the crustal density
ˆ
c
and crustal thickness
h
=
R

r
m
. The
three unknowns
r
f
,
ˆ
f
and
ˆ
m
are then solved such that the interior model is consistent with
the known mass
M
and chosen values of the moments of inertia of the whole planet
C
and that
of the mantle and crust
C
m
.
Each layer is triaxial in shape. We denote the polar attening (or geometrical ellipticity)
by

i
, dened as the dierence between the mean equatorial and polar radii, divided by the mean
spherical radius. Likewise, we denote the equatorial attening by the variable
˘
i
, dened as the
dierence between the maximum and minimum equatorial radii, divided by the mean spher-
ical radius. As above, we use the subscript
i
=
s
,
f
,
m
and
r
, to denote the polar or equa-
torial attenings at the ICB, CMB, crust-mantle boundary (CrMB), and surface.
The measured polar and equatorial attenings are taken from
Perry et al.
[2015] and their
numerical values are given in Table 1. We then assume that the ICB and CMB are both at hy-
drostatic equilibrium with the imposed gravitational potential induced by the attenings at the
CrMB and surface. The attenings at all interior boundaries are specied such that they are
consistent with the observed degree 2 spherical harmonic coecients of gravity
J

and
C
22
; their
numerical values are given in Table 1. Specically,
J

and

are connected to the principal
moments of inertia of Mercury (

2.2 The rotational model
Mercury's rotation is characterized by a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance in which it completes
3 rotations around itself for every 2 orbital revolutions around the Sun. The orbital period is
87.96935 day and the sidereal rotation period is 58.64623 day [

, 2015b]. These de-

nar with, and precess about, the normal to the Laplace plane (

To investigate Mercury's response to the gravitational torque from the Sun, we take ad-
vantage of the framework developed in
Mathews et al.
[1991] to model the forced nutations of
Earth [see also
Mathews et al.
, 2002;
Dehant and Mathews
, 2015]. This model takes into ac-
count the pressure torque (also referred to as the inertial torque) that results when the spin axis
of the uid core is misaligned from the symmetry axes of the elliptical surfaces of the CMB and
ICB. It also includes the gravitational torque exerted on the inner core when it is misaligned
with the mantle. Electromagnetic and viscous torques at both the CMB and ICB have been
incorporated into the framework [e.g
Buett
, 1992;
Buett et al.
, 2002;
Mathews and Guo
, 2005;
Deleplace and Cardin
, 2006]. The framework was adapted to model the Cassini state of the Moon
in
Dumberry and Wieczorek
[2016] and further developed in
Stys and Dumberry
[2018] and
Organowski
and Dumberry
[2020]. We adapt it here to capture the Cassini state of Mercury.
Because the forced precession period is much longer than the rotation and orbital peri-
ods of Mercury, the gravitational solar torque that is relevant to the Cassini state is the mean
torque averaged over one orbit. This mean torque is perpendicular to the Cassini plane, point-
ing in the same direction as the vector connecting the Sun to the descending node of Mercury's
orbit in Figure 1. Hence, viewed from the mantle frame, the orientation of this mean torque
is periodic, rotating at frequency
!


o
. Setting the equatorial directions
^
e
p

and
^
e

to the real and imaginary axes of the complex plane, respectively, we can write the equatorial
components of this periodic applied torque in a compact form as

(see Figure 2). The longitudinal direction of each of these angles at
a specic time

[1991].
Note that all tilded amplitudes are complex: their imaginary part reects the out-of-phase re-
sponse to the applied torque as a result of dissipation, for instance from viscous or EM coupling
{9{
Condential manuscript submitted to
JGR-Planets
at the boundaries of the uid core. In the absence of dissipation, all tilded variables are purely
real. We concentrate our analysis in this work on the real part of the solutions, which corre-
sponds to the mutual alignment of these ve rotation angles in the Cassini plane. As such, ~
"
m
corresponds to the observed obliquity of the mantle symmetry axis. It is thus equivalent to
"
m
,
though we keep the tilde notation in the presentation of our results to emphasize that it rep-
resents the real part of the solution from our system. Furthermore, since ~
m
˝
~
"
m
, we often
refer to ~
"
m
as the orientation of spin axis of the mantle, since the Cassini state of Mercury is
more customarily described in terms of the latter in the literature.
The model of
Mathews et al.
[1991] is developed under the assumption of small angles as
appropriate for the nutations on Earth. The details on how the equations of the model are de-
rived can found in
Mathews et al.
[1991] and in
Dumberry and Wieczorek
[2016]. Three equa-
tions describe, respectively, the time rate of change of the angular momenta of the whole of Mer-
cury, the uid core, and the inner core in the reference frame of the rotating mantle. These three
equations are

Solutions of the homogeneous system (i.e.
y
=
0
) represent free modes of precession. Three
modes have periods which, when seen in inertial space, are typically in the range of a few hun-
dred to a few thousand years. The rst is the free axial precession of Mercury maintained by
the solar torque acting on its elliptical gure [e.g.
Peale
, 2005]. The second is the free core nu-
tation (FCN), which is the free precession of the spin axis of the uid core about the symme-
try axis of the CMB [e.g.
Mathews et al.
, 1991]. The third is the free inner core nutation (FICN),
a free mode of rotation similar to the FCN but associated with the inner core [e.g.
Mathews et al.
,
1991].
A few remarks on our model are important to point out before we proceed further. First,
although we have retained the triaxial shape of Mercury in the expression of the solar torque,
we treat its angular momentum response as if it were an axially symmetric body. This is con-
venient as the two equatorial angular momentum equations for each region can be combined
into a single equation. To rst order, the frequency of the free precession of Mercury is not largely
altered by triaxiality [e.g.
Peale
, 2005].
Baland et al.
[2019] showed that the frequencies of the
FCN and FICN for a triaxial planetary body may be slightly dierent than those for an axi-
ally symmetric body, but not by large factor. As the response of Mercury to the solar torque
is largely determined by the resonant amplication due to the presence of these three modes,
our model should capture correctly the rst order Cassini state of Mercury. Considering the
triaxial shape of Mercury may alter the numerical results, but not our general conclusions.
Second, our modelling approach is dierent than in the studies of
Peale et al.
[2014] and
Peale et al.
[2016]. In these two studies, dynamical models of Mercury's Cassini state are de-
veloped and must then be integrated in time. The equilibrium Cassini state is the quasi-steady
state that remains after transient eects associated with the initial conditions have decayed away.
An advantage of these models compared to ours is that the complete triaxial dynamics of Mer-
cury, including its longitudinal librations, are retained. However, the numerical integration can
be lengthy if dissipation is weak, which restricts the number of possible interior models of Mer-
cury that can be tested. In contrast, our model is a simple linear system in the frequency do-
main, focused on one specic frequency: the forced precession associated with the Cassini state.
Solutions are straightforward to obtain for a given interior model, and this allows us to cover
a larger span of the parameter space. One drawback, however, is that our model does not cap-
ture time-dependent variations at any other frequencies, including the precession of the peri-
center of Mercury's orbit about the Sun.

Two free modes of precession are found by setting

responds to the Eulerian wobble, or Chandler wobble, and represents the prograde precession
of the rotation axis about the symmetry axis. The second mode is the free retrograde axial pre-
cession of Mercury. As seen in the inertial frame, its frequency is given by

These estimates are similar to those obtained by
Peale
[2005]. Because the CMB is elliptical,
the pressure torque exerted on the uid core by the mantle leads to an entrainment of the uid
core, the degree of which depends on the amplitude of the pole-to-equator CMB attening. The
true free precession period lies somewhere between 560 and 1298 yr. Regardless of its exact value,
the free precession period is much shorter than the forcing period of 325 kyr. Using Equation
(29), Equation (27) can be written as [e.g.

just as a large mantle obliquity can result from resonant amplication when the forcing frequency

onant amplication when the forcing frequency approaches the FCN or FICN frequencies. These
frequencies depend on the interior density structure and are not known. However, we will show
that for reasonable interior models of Mercury, the FCN and FICN periods are in the range of
a few hundred yr. This is suciently far from the forcing period (325 kyr) that we do not ex-
pect an important amplication eect. Furthermore, since

3 Results
3.1 Geodetic constraints and interior density structure
All our interior models are constrained to match the mass
M
of Mercury and specic choices
of
^
C
=
C=MR
2
and
C
m
=C
. The choice of
^
C
is determined from Equation (28). For the pa-
rameters listed in Table 1, and an observed obliquity of
"
m
= 2
:
04 arcmin [
Margot et al.
, 2012],
this gives
^
C
=
C=MR
2
= 0
:
3455 and all our interior models are consistent with this choice.
Obviously, this reects a Cassini state equilibrium in which the uid core and inner core are
{15{

JGR-Planets
perfectly aligned with the mantle, which is not strictly correct. Hence, we make an error in es-
timating
^
C
from Equation (28), or conversely in predicting
"
m
based on a given choice for
^
C
.
Part of the objective of our study is to estimate how large this error is. The ratio
C

is ob-
tained from the amplitude of the 88-day longitudinal mantle libration

For all results presented in our study, the crustal density is set at
ˆ
c
= 2974 kg m

3
[
Sori
,
2018]. Our standard choice for the crustal thickness is
h
= 26 km [
Sori
, 2018], although in
section 3.2 we also present some results with other choices of
h
. We have considered two pos-
sible prescriptions connected to the density of the inner core. First, for all the results presented
in sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, we have used a xed inner core density of
ˆ
s
= 8800 kg m

3
ap-
proximately that obtained in
Dumberry and Rivoldini
[2015] under the assumption of a pure
Fe composition in face-centered cubic phase. This captures an end-member scenario where the
core composition is an Fe-S alloy; at Mercury's core conditions, crystallization of Fe is relatively
free of S on the Fe-rich side of the eutectic [
Li et al.
, 2001]. If the core composition is instead
an Fe-Si alloy, approximately equal partitioning of Si between the liquid and solid phase [e.g.
Schaefer et al.
, 2017] implies a weak chemical contrast at the ICB. The density jump across the
ICB is expected to be small, although since density increases with depth, the contrast between
the mean densities of the uid and solid cores is larger. It is these mean densities that enter
our Mercury model with uniform density layers. To capture this other end-member core com-
position scenario, in section 3.5 we present results where we instead prescribe a xed density
contrast between the uid and solid core; specically, we set the numerical value of

3
.
For a given choice of inner core radius
r
s
, the densities of the mantle (
ˆ
m
) and uid core
(
ˆ
f
) and the radius of the CMB (
r
f
) are determined such that the interior model matches
M

^
C

3455 and
^
C
m

1475. Figure 3a shows how
ˆ
m
,
ˆ
f
and
r
f
vary as a function of in-
ner core radius
r
s
for each of the two inner core density scenarios: a xed
ˆ
s
, or a xed

3
. When
the inner core is small, its presence has a limited inuence on the resulting density structure,
and we nd
ˆ
m
= 3197 kg m

3
,
ˆ
f
= 7263 kg m

3
and
r
f
= 2000 km in each of the two
scenarios. When
ˆ
s
is xed to 8800 kg m

3
, as the inner core reaches 1500 km in size,
r
f
in-
creases to above 2100 km,
ˆ
m
approaches 4000 kg m

3
and
ˆ
f
is reduced to below 5000 kg m

3
.
Figure 3a illustrates that when adopting a xed
ˆ
s
, there is a limit in the possible inner core
size, as otherwise
ˆ
m
gets unreasonably large and
ˆ
f
gets inappropriately small (as it would
require an excessively large concentration of light elements). When adopting instead a xed den-
sity contrast, with

3
= 0
:
1, the changes in
r
f
,
ˆ
m
and
ˆ
f
with inner core radius are more mod-
est, allowing larger possible inner core sizes. Dierent assumptions on
ˆ
c
and
h
would alter the
numerical values shown on Figure 3a but not their trends with
r
s
.
Figure 3b shows how the FCN and FICN periods vary with

core density scenarios and in the absence of viscous and EM coupling (i.e.

0). Both of these free modes are retrograde. The FCN period is close to 400 yr for a small in-
ner core, increasing to approximately 600 yr at the largest
r
s
. The FICN period is shorter, close
to 100 yr (160 yr) for a small inner core and decreasing to approximately 40 yr (120 yr) at the
largest
r
s
under the xed
ˆ
s
(xed

) scenario. This conrms that the FCN and FICN peri-
ods are both much shorter than the forcing precession period of 325 kyr and suciently far away
from it that we do not expect large ~
m
f
and ~
n
s
from resonant amplication.
The FCN and FICN periods that we have computed include the inuence of the exter-
nal torque. As shown by
Baland et al.
[2019], the external torque allow solid regions to have
a free motion in inertial space thereby aecting the free rotational modes. To a good approx-
imation, the FCN and FICN frequencies (as seen in an inertial frame) for

the gravitational torque dominates the inertial torque, in large part because of the slow rota-

is retrograde). This is also the case for the Moon [e.g.
Dumberry and Wieczorek

Stys and
Dumberry

This frequency is slightly dierent from the usual expression for Earth, involving the ratio

A=

A=

A
m
. This is because of the relatively thin mantle of Mercury; for the largest
r
s
considered, the moment of inertia of the inner core can get close to 40% of that of the man-
tle and is not negligible. The period of the FCN when only interior torques contribute is shown
in Figure 3b. It is close to 1100 yr for a small inner core, increasing to approximately 1500 yr
at the largest
r
s
. Hence, the inuence of the solar torque reduces the FCN period by a factor
of approximately 3. We note that the FICN period, in contrast, is not altered substantially when
the external torque is set to zero.
3.2 Gravitational and inertial coupling
Let us now investigate the obliquities of the mantle, uid core and inner core in their equi-
librium Cassini state. We assume a xed inner core density scenario in this section, with
ˆ
s
=
8800 kg m

3
. Viscous and EM coupling are set to zero in order to isolate the inuence of grav-
itational and inertial coupling. Figure 4 shows how ~
"
m
, ~
m
f
and ~
n
s
vary as functions of inner
core radius. We show calculations for three dierent choices of crustal thickness, but let us con-
centrate rst on the case for
h
= 26 km. For small
r
s
, we retrieve an obliquity of ~
"
m
= 2
:
0494
arcmin (Figure 4a). ~
"
m
decreases with
r
s
, but not substantially; at the largest
r
s
(1500 km),
~
"
m
= 2
:
0460 arcmin, a decrease of 0.0034 arcmin. The maximum dierence from ~
"
m
= 2
:
04
arcmin, the obliquity that we used in setting the constraint for
^
C
{ and hence the prediction
we should recover for a rigid planet { is an overestimate of approximately 0
:
01 arcmin which
occurs for small inner cores.
The deviation of ~
"
m
from that of a rigid planet is due to the misalignments of the uid
core (~
m
f
) and solid inner core (~
n
s
) with respect to the mantle (Figure 4b). The misalignment
of the uid core spin axis from the mantle is signicant: ~
m
f
is approximately 4.02 arcmin for
a small inner core and does not vary substantially with inner core size; it drops to 3.97 arcmin
at the largest
r
s
. Recall that ~
m
f
is measured with respect to the mantle rotation axis (which
coincides closely with the symmetry axis), so the obliquity of the spin axis of the uid core with
respect to the orbit normal is ~
"
m
+~
m
f
ˇ
6 arcmin. The reason why the obliquity of the spin
axis of the uid core is larger than that of the mantle can be understood from Equation (32b),
which shows that ~
m
f
is determined by the resonant amplication of the FCN mode at the forc-
ing frequency. When the FCN frequency is much larger than the forcing frequency, as is the
case for Mercury, the resonant amplication is very weak but remains present and ~
m
f
is larger
than zero.
In contrast to ~
m
f
, the misalignment of the inner core with respect to the mantle is much
smaller; ~
n
s
is approximately between 0.023-0.025 arcmin, a factor 80 times smaller than ~
"
m
.
Physically, this is because the gravitational torque acting on the inner core when it is tilted from
the mantle is much stronger than the inertial torque acting at the ICB. As a result, the inner
core must remain in close alignment with the mantle. Presented dierently, since the FICN pe-
riod is more than 3000 times shorter than the forced precession period, the inner core can eas-

decreases with inner core size and, consequently,
~
"
m
also decreases with inner core size, as seen in Figure 4a, though it remains larger than the
prediction for a rigid planet.
The specic predictions of ~
"
m
, ~
m
f
and ~
n
s
on Figure 4 depend sensitively on the assumed
interior density model and on the dynamical ellipticities of the inner core (
e
s
) and uid core
(
e
f
). Hence, it depends on the choices we have made for the inner core density
ˆ
s
, the crustal
density
ˆ
c
and its thickness
h
. Changing
ˆ
s
,
ˆ
c
and/or
h
requires a dierent combination of
ˆ
f
,
ˆ
m
and
r
f
in order to match
M
,
^
C
and
^
C
m
. In turn, this leads to dierent ellipticities at in-
terior boundary in order to match
J
2
and
C
22
, and thus dierent predictions for ~
"
m
, ~
m
f
and
~
n
s
. To illustrate this, we show on Figure 4 two additional predictions computed with crustal
thicknesses changed to
h
= 16 and 36 km. The change in ~
"
m
remains modest,
˘
0
:
025%, but
the changes in ~
m
f
and ~
n
s
are more substantial,
˘
5% and
˘
10%, respectively.
We also show on Figure 4a (only for
h
= 26 km) the obliquity of the principal moment
of inertia of the whole planet, which we denote by ~
"
g
. A dierence between ~
"
g
and ~
"
m
occurs
if the inner core is misaligned with the mantle. As seen in the mantle frame, a tilted inner core
(with ~
n
s
assumed small) leads to an o-diagonal component of the moment of inertia tensor
of (

~

the moment of inertia of the whole planet is purely diagonal is (

Since the inner core is gravitationally forced into a close alignment with the mantle, the dif-
ference between ~
"
g
and ~
"
m
remains very small. For the largest inner core radius that we have
considered, ~
"
g
diers from ~

only by approximately 0.001 arcmin.
3.3 Viscous coupling
We now investigate how viscous coupling at the CMB and ICB aects the equilibrium Cassini
state.
Peale et al.
[2014] present two dierent parameterizations of viscous coupling based on
the timescale of attenuation of the dierential rotation between the uid core and mantle. More
complete analytical solutions for the ow resulting from a dierentially precessing shell have
been derived [e.g.
Stewartson and Roberts
, 1963;
Busse
, 1968;
Rochester
, 1976] and we exploit
these solutions here. The parametrization of the viscous coupling constants
K

and
K
icb
based
on them are given in

that the viscous friction between the uid core and mantle should induce turbulent ows, as
is the case for the Cassini state of the Moon [
Yoder
, 1981;
Williams et al.
, 2001;
Cebron et al.
,
2019]. For a boundary layer that involves turbulent ows, the viscous torque should be inde-
pendent of the uid viscosity and proportional to the square of the dierential velocity. The

corporating a viscous coupling of this form in our rotational model is more challenging not only
because

. One
strategy is to nd solutions through an iterative process. The simpler alternative strategy that
we adopt is to use the laminar formulas of Equation (44) but with the understanding that

To give an estimate of an appropriate turbulent value for

of the Moon. A measure of the viscous dissipation at the CMB of the Moon has been obtained
by tting a rotation model to the librations of the Moon observed by Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR)

Williams et al.
, 2001], more than 10 times
larger than our estimate for Mercury above. Since the eective turbulent coupling constant
K

is proportional to the dierential velocity, the eective turbulent viscosity appropriate for Mer-
cury should be smaller. Thus,

and they are essentially unchanged from the solutions shown in Figure 4. With increasing

locity, and ~
m

is reduced. With the reduced dierential velocity at the CMB, the prediction
of ~
"

gets closer to 2.04 arcmin, the obliquity expected for a rigid planet. Although our CMB
viscous coupling model is dierent than the one used by
Peale et al.
[2014], our results for ~

m
and ~
m

are qualitatively similar: viscous coupling at the CMB acts to reduce the oset of the
uid spin axis from the mantle symmetry axis. Considering the upper bound in turbulent vis-

remains modest, reducing its amplitude by a maximum of approximately 0.0015

The inclusion of viscous coupling at the ICB can lead to a substantial change in inner core
tilt. A larger viscosity leads to stronger viscous coupling and to a closer alignment of the in-
ner core with the uid core spin axis. The viscous coupling strength is inversely proportional
to
r
s
, so a larger viscosity results in a larger inner core radius at which viscous coupling is of
a similar magnitude to gravitational coupling. Taking again an upper bound of

, Figure 5 indicates that ~
n
s
may be 1 arcmin or larger only if the inner core radius is
smaller than approximately 100 km. For an inner core of a few hundred km in radius, gravi-
tational coupling is much larger than viscous coupling, and the inner core tilt is limited to a
fraction of 1 arcmin.
The larger inner core tilt observed with increasing eective viscosity results in a larger
oset between the obliquity of the principal moment of inertia ~
"
g
and that of the mantle ~

,
though it remains limited. For the upper bound of

is limited to 0.0013 arcmin.
The conclusion that emerges from Figure 5 is that the larger the inner core is, the smaller
the misalignments of both the uid core and inner core are with respect to the mantle. This
implies that the larger the inner core is, the more we approach a planet precessing as a rigid
body, although the misalignment of the spin axis of the uid core remains important, approx-
imately 3-4 arcmin away from the mantle symmetry axis. The specic way in which ~
"
m
, ~
m
f
and ~
n
s
change with inner core size would certainly be dierent for a turbulent model of viscous
coupling. But the general conclusion remains that the addition of viscous coupling at the CMB
and ICB does not signicantly modify the Cassini state equilibrium angle of the mantle.

3.4 Electromagnetic coupling
Let us now turn to electromagnetic (EM) coupling. To focus on its role in the equilibrium
Cassini state, we set the viscous coupling back to zero. Because magnetic eld lines tend to re-
main attached to electrically conducting materials, a dierential tangential motion between two
electrically conducting regions stretches existing magnetic eld lines that thread their interface.
This induces a secondary magnetic eld (or equivalently, an electrical current) and an associ-
ated tangential EM stress resisting the dierential motion. EM coupling at the CMB and ICB
acts then in a similar way to viscous coupling, and this 'magnetic friction' depends on the strength
of the radial magnetic eld
B
r
and the electrical conductivity
˙
on either side of the bound-
ary [
Rochester
, 1960, 1962, 1968].
The parametrization of EM coupling in terms of the coupling constants
K
cmb
and
K
icb
has been developed in a few studies [e.g.
Buett
, 1992;
Buett et al.

CMB is much weaker than viscous coupling, even if we include other spherical harmonic com-
ponents of the radial magnetic eld.
EM coupling can be enhanced if strongly stratied pockets of core uid are trapped by
CMB cavities [
Buett
, 2010;
Glane and Buett
, 2018], in which case the eective
˙

could be
closer to

f
. Likewise,
˙
m
can be increased if a more electrically conducting layer has formed
at the bottom of Mercury's mantle, for instance by the upward sedimentation and compaction
of solid FeS crystals precipitating out of the uid core [e.g.
Hauck et al.
, 2013]. However, even

smaller by a factor
˘
60 than the smallest possible viscous coupling constant. Viscous forces
dominate the tangential stress on the CMB of Mercury.
At the ICB, because we can expect the electrical conductivity in both the solid inner core
and uid core to be similar, and because the radial magnetic eld is likely much stronger, EM
coupling can be much larger and dominate viscous coupling. We assume that the magnetic eld
morphology at the ICB is dominantly comprised of small spatial scales for example as predicted
by the dynamo model of
Christensen
[2006]. EM coupling in this case can be parametrized in
terms of an equivalent uniform radial magnetic eld
h
B
r
i
capturing its r.m.s. strength [
Buf-
fett et al.
, 2002;
Dumberry and Koot
, 2012]. Assuming an electrical conductivity
˙
equal in the
uid and solid core, the coupling constant
K

can be written in the form
K

and where

o
) is the magnetic skin depth. As
F
icb
is inversely proportional to
r
s
,
K
icb
is inversely proportional to inner core size. Note that computing the EM coupling based
on the r.m.s. strength
h
B
r
i
rather than a true eld morphology tends to overestimate the strength
of the coupling [
Koot and Dumberry
, 2013]. However, since the strength of the radial magnetic
eld at the ICB of Mercury is largely unknown, imperfections of the EM coupling model are
absorbed in the range of possible
h
B
r
i
values.
The parametrization of Equation (50) is only valid in a 'weak eld' regime [
Buett et al.
,
2002], when the feedback from the Lorentz force on the ow in the uid core can be neglected.
When
h
B
r
i
is suciently large, this is no longer the case. EM coupling then enters a 'strong
eld' regime [
Buett et al.
, 2002;
Dumberry and Koot
, 2012;
Koot and Dumberry
, 2013] in which
K
icb
increases linearly with
h
B

instead of quadratically. A good approximation of
K

cal-
culated for Earth can be extracted from Figure 6a of

h

at the ICB

Christensen
[2006] showed that the eld geom-
etry inside the core could be dominated by small length scales, yet only the weaker lower har-
monics of the eld would penetrate through a thermally stratied layer in the upper region of
{24{
Condential manuscript submitted to

the uid core and reach the surface. If so, the eld strength inside the core can exceed the sur-
face eld strength by a factor 1000. Taking a surface eld strength equal to
˘
300 nT [e.g
An-
derson et al.
, 2012],
h
B
r
i
at the ICB could be as large as 0.3 mT, corresponding to approxi-
mately 10% of the eld strength within Earth's core. Given that it is perhaps unlikely that Mer-
cury's eld can be as high as that in Earth's core, in all likelihood EM coupling at the ICB of
Mercury remains in the weak eld regime.
Figure 6 shows how ~
"
m
, ~
m
f
and ~
n
s
vary as functions of inner core radius for dierent choices
of
h
B
r
i
. The larger
h
B
r
i
is, the stronger is the EM coupling at the ICB, and the smaller is the
dierential rotation between the uid core and inner core. The inner core and uid core are vir-
tually locked into a common precession motion when
h
B
r
i
>
0
:
3 mT. Further increasing
h
B
r
i
above 1 mT does not change the solution as EM coupling already dominates all other torques
on the inner core. This is the case even when EM coupling transitions into the strong eld regime.
EM coupling at the CMB is included in these calculations, with
˙
m
= 1 S m

1
and


g

=
190 nT, but remains much weaker than the inertial torque at the CMB, so for a small inner core
we retrieved the solutions of ~
"
m
and ~
m
f
shown in Figure 4.
As the inner core radius is increased, both ~
"
m
and ~
m
f
get smaller, as it was the case with
viscous coupling alone, although the addition of EM coupling lead to more substantial changes.
The inner core needs to be larger than approximately 500 km for changes in the Cassini state
equilibrium to be noticeable. It is important to point out that ~
m
f
is reduced not because of
EM coupling at the CMB, but rather from the combination of EM coupling at the ICB, which
pulls the uid core towards an alignment with the inner core, and gravitational coupling on the
inner core, which pulls the latter to align with the mantle. The larger the EM coupling is, the
greater is the reduction in ~
"
m
and ~
m
f
.
When the EM coupling at the ICB is suciently strong that the uid and solid cores are
locked into a common precession motion, a good approximation of ~

is given by the same pre-
diction as Equations (39-40) involving the eective moment of inertia

The larger the inner core is, the smaller are the misalignments of the uid and solid cores
with respect to the mantle. Hence, the general conclusion we reached for viscous coupling alone
is not altered with the addition of EM coupling but further strengthened; the larger the inner
core is, the closer we approach a planet precessing as a rigid body. This is best revealed by the
obliquity of the gravity eld ~
"
g
which, for a large inner core, asymptotically approaches the obliq-
uity expected for a rigid planet. Note that with strong EM coupling at the ICB, the oset be-
tween ~

Coupling models when viscous and EM stresses are both present have been presented in

for the Cassini state equilibrium of Mercury, the tangential stress at the CMB is dominated by
viscous forces, and that at the ICB should be dominated by EM forces. To simplify, we con-
sider a model where
K
cmb
is purely from viscous coupling and
K
icb
purely from EM coupling.
We choose an eective viscosity at the CMB of

, which we believe to be a
representative value given the comparison with the Moon (see section 3.3). We take a radial
eld strength at the ICB of

= 0
:
3 mT, approximately the eld strength expected under
the dynamo scenario of
Christensen
[2006]. We adopt these values as those of a `representa-
tive' coupling model, although the uncertainty on

obviously remains high.
Figure 7 shows how ~

and ~

vary with inner core radius for the 'representative'
coupling model (black lines) under the xed inner core density scenario that we have used in
sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4. Figure 7 also shows how the results change when, for the same rep-
resentative coupling model, we adopt instead a xed density contrast between the uid and solid
cores and for dierent choices of

3
(coloured lines). For a relatively high density contrast (

3
=
0
:
2), the results are qualitatively similar to the xed inner core density scenario. For a smaller

3
, the point at which the orientation of the co-precessing uid and inner cores begins to be
pulled into an alignment with the mantle is pushed to a larger inner core radius. However, the
general behaviour of ~
"
m
, ~
m
f
and ~
n
s
as functions of inner core radius is unchanged. Hence, all
our results in the previous three sections would be qualitatively similar under a xed density
contrast scenario. A smaller density contrast at the ICB only implies that a larger inner core
is required in order to produce an equivalent change in the Cassini state equilibrium.
4 Discussion
The study of
Peale et al.
[2016] also presented predictions of the obliquities of the man-
tle, uid core and inner core associated with the equilibrium Cassini state of Mercury. Their
model included the tangential viscous stress at the ICB and CMB, but not the EM stress. Their
Table 1 gives the obliquities of the mantle, uid core and inner core, denoted respectively as

size is increased, the mantle obliquity

gets progressively larger and is displaced further away
from its expected orientation based of a rigid planet (see their Figure 6). The change in

they
obtain between a case with no inner core and an inner core radius equal to 0.6 times the plan-
etary radius (
ˇ
1463 km, close to the maximum inner core size of 1500 km we have considered),
is approximately an increase of 5

10

rad = 0.17 arcmin. This also corresponds approxi-
mately to the deviation of the obliquity with respect to that of a rigid planet.
When only viscous stress is included in our model (section 3.3), our results are substan-
tially dierent. As illustrated in Figure 4, we nd instead that the obliquity of the uid core
gets smaller with inner core size and that the change is very modest. In contrast with the re-
sults of
Peale et al.
[2016], we nd that the inner core obliquity is typically smaller than that
of the uid core, except when the inner core is very small or when the eective viscosity is un-
reasonably large. We also nd that as the inner core size is increased, the mantle obliquity gets
smaller, opposite to the results of
Peale et al.
[2016], and that the changes remain small, at most
of the order of 0.005 arcmin. A part of the dierence is due to the dierent viscous coupling
model that we use. But even when we adopt their model parameters and use their viscosity model,
we were not able to reproduce their results.
In the absence of viscous and EM coupling, the strong gravitational torque exerted on the
inner core by the mantle should prevent any large misalignment between the two. This is cap-
tured by the period of the FICN, which is of the order of 100 yr, much shorter than the forc-
ing period of 325 kyr. Viscous and/or EM coupling at the ICB can counteract the gravitational
torque (and alter the period of the FICN), but only for a small inner core. The ratio of the viscous-
EM torque to the gravitational torque decreases with inner core size, so a large inner core should
be more strongly aligned with the mantle. The more strongly the inner core and mantle are
{27{
Condential manuscript submitted to
JGR-Planets
gravitationally locked together, the more they behave as a single rigid body in response to the
external torque from the Sun. We expect then that the obliquity of the mantle should be brought
closer to that of a rigid planet when the inner core is larger. Hence, we nd puzzling the re-
sults of
Peale et al.
[2016], which suggest the opposite.
We showed that EM coupling is most likely larger than viscous coupling at the ICB, even
though our knowledge of the radial magnetic eld strength inside Mercury (on which EM cou-
pling depends) remains poor. If the magnetic eld strength at the ICB is above 0.3 mT, EM
coupling is suciently strong to bring the uid and solid cores into a locked procession motion.
The larger the inner core is, the more this co-precessing core is forced into an alignment with
the mantle because of the mantle gravitational torque on the inner core. As a result, the larger
the inner core is, the closer we approach a situation resembling a whole planet precessing as
a rigid body. The addition of EM coupling at the ICB does not change the overall picture that
we observe with viscous coupling alone; the mantle obliquity decreases with inner core size. The
amplitude of the decrease can be as large as 0.015 arcmin, 3 times larger than for viscous cou-
pling alone; this remains a factor 10 smaller than the changes suggested in
Peale et al.
[2016],
and again, importantly, in the reverse direction.
Our results suggest then that the presence and size of an inner core leads to only mod-
est changes of the mantle obliquity
"
m
compared to the obliquity predicted on the basis of an
entirely rigid planet (
"
r
m
). Let us denote this dierence as 
"
m
=
"
m

"
r
m
. The largest 
"
m
occurs for a small or no inner core, and is 
"
m
ˇ
0
:
01 arcmin. This dierence is decreased
as the inner core size is increased. For a suciently large inner core, in the case of a strong EM
coupling and large density contrast at the ICB, 
"
m
can be negative, but its absolute value
remains smaller than 0.01 arcmin.
To put these results in perspective, the uncertainty in the measurement of the mantle obliq-
uity reported by
Margot et al.
[2012] and
Stark et al.
[2015a] is of the order of 0.08 arcmin, much
larger than this dierence. This means that, at the current level of precision, it is not possi-
ble to distinguish the position of the mantle obliquity from the obliquity of a rigid planet. This
is consistent with the fact that the observed obliquity falls close to that expected from a rigid
planet. But it also implies that the observed obliquity cannot be used to place constraints on
the inner core size.
Nevertheless, our results show that the presence of a uid core and inner core aect the
resulting mantle obliquity by as much as 0.01 arcmin. This is of the same order as the change
in obliquity caused by elastic tidal deformation, which is of the order of 0.35 arcsec (
ˇ
0
:
006
arcmin) [
Baland et al.
, 2017]. This is also of the same order as the amplitude of the nutation
motion about the mean equilibrium Cassini state forced by the precession of the pericenter, which
is approximately 0.85 arcsec (
ˇ
0
:
014 arcmin) [
Baland et al.
, 2017]. The precision on the obliq-
uity from the upcoming BepiColombo satellite mission is expected to be

0
:
5 arcsec (

0
:
008
arcmin) [
Cicalo et al.
, 2016]. Thus, in addition to including tidal deformation and the preces-
sion of the pericenter, a Cassini state model that includes a uid and solid core will then be
necessary in order to properly tie Mercury's obliquity to its interior structure. In turn, this opens
the possibility of further constraining the interior structure of Mercury on the basis of its obliq-
uity.
Obliquity measurements based on tracking topographic features reect the orientation of
the spin-symmetry axis of the mantle (
"
m
). Measurements based on tracking the gravity eld
of Mercury reect instead the orientation of the principal moment of the whole planet (
"
g
). These
two orientations do not coincide when an inner core is present and is misaligned from the man-
tle. Since gravitational coupling prevents a large inner core tilt with respect to the mantle, we
{28{

nd that the misalignment 
"
g
=
"
g

"
m
is limited. The maximum oset that we obtain
is approximately 
"
g
ˇ
0
:
007 arcmin. This limited magnitude of oset is important in the
light of the recent obliquity of the gravity eld estimated in
Genova et al.
[2019],
"
g
= 1
:
968

0
:
027 arcmin. This is substantially smaller than the two mesurements of the obliquity of the
spin-symmetry axis of the mantle:
"
m

:
04

0
:
08 arcmin [
Margot et al.
, 2012] and
"
m
=
2
:
029

0
:
085 arcmin [
Stark et al.
, 2015a], although all three measurements remain consistent
with one another within their error estimates. In their interpretation,
Genova et al.
[2019] sug-
gest that the dierent central value of the obliquity that they obtain (smaller by
˘
0
:
07 ar-
cmin) is perhaps explained by an oset 
"
g
due to the presence of a (possibly large) solid in-
ner core. However, this is one order of magnitude larger than the maximum magnitude of 
"
g
that we predict. Moreover, we predict that the obliquity of the gravity eld should be larger
than that of the mantle spin axis, not smaller. Hence, at the present-day level of the precision
of the measurements,
"
g
and
"
m
should coincide, and their dierence cannot be interpreted as
reecting the misalignment between the polar moment of inertia of the whole planet and the
mantle spin axis.
Lastly, we have concentrated our eorts on the mutual orientations of the dierent spin
and symmetry axes in the Cassini plane. Dissipation at the CMB and ICB introduced by vis-
cous and EM coupling also lead to a displacement of these axes in the direction perpendicu-
lar to the Cassini plane [e.g
Peale et al.
, 2014]. Indeed, the two measurements based on track-
ing surface topographic features from
Margot et al.
[2012] and
Stark et al.
[2015a] suggest that
the mantle spin axis lags behind the Cassini plane by approximately 2 arcsec (
˘
0
:
03 arcmin).
Although this oset is smaller than the measurement errors, so that the observed obliquity is
still consistent with no deviation away from the Cassini plane, some amount of dissipation in-
variably takes place. These measurements give then a measure of the possible amplitude of the
dissipation. One source of dissipation is from anelastic tidal deformation [
Baland et al.
, 2017],
but viscous and EM coupling at the boundaries of the uid core is another. Hence, the out-of-
plane component of the observed obliquity may further help to quantify and constrain the in-
terior coupling mechanisms. This will be the subject of a future study.
5 Conclusion
We have investigated how the presence of a uid core and solid inner core aects the Cassini
state equilibrium of Mercury. Our general conclusion is that the coupling strength between Mer-
cury's interior regions is suciently strong that the obliquity of the mantle spin-symmetry axis
does not deviate from that of a rigid planet by more than 0.01 arcmin. This largest oset oc-
curs for a small or no inner core. The larger the inner core is, the more it is forced into an align-
ment with the mantle because of the strong gravitational torque between the two, and the closer
we approach a situation resembling a whole planet precessing as a rigid body. The misalign-
ment between the polar moment of inertia and mantle spin axis increases with inner core size,
but is limited to approximately 0.007 arcmin. These conclusions apply irrespective of the core
composition and thus of the partitioning of light elements into the solid core; a smaller den-
sity contrast at the ICB only implies that a larger inner core is required in order to produce
an equivalent change in the Cassini state equilibrium.
Our results imply that the obliquities of the mantle spin axis and polar moment of iner-
tia (or, equivalently, the gravity eld) should coincide at the present-day level of measurement
errors. Moreover, neither of these can be distinguished from the obliquity predicted on the ba-
sis of a rigid planet. However, the smaller measurement errors expected from the upcoming Bepi-
Columbo satellite mission may permit this distinction, and thus provide further constraints on
Mercury's interior structure.
