Abstract
We present a mo del of the Cassini state of Mercury that comprises an inner core, a
uid core
and a mantle. Our mo del includes inertial and g ravitational torques b etwe en interior regions,
and viscous and electromagnetic (EM) coupling at the b oundaries of the
uid core. We show
that the coupling b etween Me rc ury's interior regions is suciently strong that the obliquity of
the mantle spin axis deviates from that of a rigid planet by no m ore than 0.01 arcmin. The man-
tle obliquity decreases with increasing inner core size, but the change b etween a large and no
inner core is limited to 0.015 arcmin. EM coupling is stronger than viscous coupling at the in-
ner core b oundary and, if the c ore magnetic eld strength is ab ove 0.3 mT, lo cks the
uid and
solid cores into a common precession mo tion. Because of the strong gravitational coupling b e-
tween the mantle and inner core, the larger the inner core is, the more this co-precessing core
is brought into an alignment with the mantle, and the more the obliquity of the p olar moment
of inertia approa ches that exp ected for a rigid planet. The misalignment b e tween the p olar mo-
ment of inertia and mantle spin axis increases with inner core size, but is limited to 0.007 ar-
cmin. Our results imply that the measured obliquities of the mantle spin axis and p olar mo-
ment of inertia should coincide at the prese nt-day level of measurement errors, and cannot b e
distinguished from the obliquity of a rigid planet.
Plain l anguage summary:
The plane of Mercury's orbit around the Sun is slowly precess-
ing ab out an axis xed in space. This entrains a precession of the spin axis of Mercury at the
same rate , an equilibrium known as a C assini state. The angle b etween the spin axis and the
normal to the orbital plane is known as the obliquity and remains xed. Observations have con-
rmed that Mercury's obliquity matches, within measurement errors, the the oretical predic-
tion based on an entirely rigid planet. However, we know that Mercury has a large metallic core
which is liquid, although the central part may b e solid. In this work, we investigate how the
presence of a
uid and solid core aect the Cassini state of Mercury. We show that the inter-
nal coupling b etween the solid core,
uid core and the mantle is suciently strong that the obliq-
uity of the mantle do e s not depart from that of a rigid planet by more than 0.01 arcmin, an
oset s maller than the prese nt-day error in measurements. We also show that the larger the
solid inner core is, the more the planet b ehaves as if it were precessing as an entirely rigid b o dy.
1 Intro duction
Mercury is exp ecte d to b e in a Cassini state (Figure 1) whereby its orbit normal and spin-
symmetry axis are b oth coplanar with, and precess ab out, the normal to the Laplace plane [
Colombo
,
1966;
Peale
, 1969, 2006]. The orientation of the Laplace plane varies on long tim escales, but
its present-day orientation can b e reconstructed from ephemerides data [
Yseboodt and Margot
,
2006;
Baland et al.
, 2017]. Likewise, the rate of precess ion is also not observed directly, but is
reconstructed by ephemerides data. The latest e stimate is a retrograde precession p erio d of 325,513
yr with an inclination angle of
I
= 8
:
5330

b etween the orbit and Laplace plane normals [
Ba-
land et al.
, 2017]. Measurements of the obliquity
"
m
, dened as the angle of misalignment b e-
twe en the spin-symmetry axis and the orbit normal, have b een obtained by dierent techniques,
including ground based radar observations [
Margot et al.
, 2007, 2012], and stereo digital ter-
rain images [
Stark et al.
, 2015a] and radio tracking data [

Genova et al.
, 2019;
Konopliv et al.
, 2020] from the MErcury Surface Space ENvi-
ronment GEo chemistry and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft. Within measurement errors,
all technique s yield an obliquity which is coplanar with the orbit and Laplace plane normals
and consistent with a Cassini state. Furthermore, the observed obliquity angle (2

The prediction of Mercury's obliquity is based on the assumption that the whole planet
precesses as a single b o dy. However, we know that Mercury has a
uid core from two main lines
of evidence. First, Mercury's large scale magnetic eld is intrinsic, and must b e maintained by
dynamo action [
Anderson et al.
, 2011, 2012;
Johnson et al.
, 2012]. This requires
uid motion
in its metallic core, and hence that Mercury's core is at least partially liquid. Second, the ob-
served amplitude of the 88-day longitudinal libration is approximately twice as large as that
exp ected if Me rc ury were librating as a rigid b o dy [
Margot et al.
, 2007, 2012;
Stark et al.
, 2015a].
This indicates that it is only the mantle that librates, and that the outer part of the c ore is
uid.
These e vide nc es do not ne cessarily imply that the whole of Merc ury's core is
uid, but only that
its outermost part must b e. A solid inner core may have nucleated at the centre although its
size is not well constrained. Inner core growth leads to planetary contraction, and the inferred
radial contrac tion of
˘
7 km since the late heavy b ombardment [
Byrne et al.
, 2014] places an
approximate lim it of 800 km on the inner core radius [
Grott et al.
, 2011]. Howeve r, the inner
core could b e larger if a signicant fraction of its growth o ccurred earlier in Mercury's history.

With a
uid core, and p ossibly a solid inner core, the observed obliquity
"
m
re
ects the
orientation of the spin-symmetry axis of the prec essing mantle and crust alone. Neglecting dis-
sipation, and at equilibrium in the Cassini state, the spin axis of the
uid core and the spin-
symmetry axis of the inner core should b oth also precess ab out the norm al to the Laplac e plane
in a retrograde direction with a p erio d of 325,513 yr. Both of these axes should also lie in the
plane that denes the equilibrium Cas sini state [e.g.
Dumberry and Wieczorek
, 2016], although
their obliquity angles may b e dierent than
"
m
. Whether the spin axis of the
uid core is brought
into an alignment with the mantle obliquity dep ends primarily on the pressure torque (als o re-
ferred to as the inertial torque) exerted by the centrifugal forc e of the rotating
uid core on the
misaligned elliptical shap e of the core-m antle b oundary (CMB) [
Poincare
, 1910]. The more
at-
tened the CMB is, the stronger the pressure torque is, and the more the
uid core is entrained
into a co-precession at a similar obliquity to that of the mantle. The
attening of Mercury's
CMB is not known. But if one assumes that the top ography of the C MB coincides with an equip o-
tential surfac e at hydrostatic equilibrium with the im p osed frozen-in mass anomalies in the up-
p er mantle and crust, then the pressure torque at the CMB is sucient to bring the
uid core
into a close alignment with the mantle [
Peale et al.
, 2014]. The spin axis of the
uid core is not
exp ected to b e exactly aligned with the spin-symmetry axis of the mantle , but suciently close
that the resulting mantle obliquity do es not dier much from that of a single b o dy planet. Fur-
thermore, viscous and electromagnetic (EM) coupling at the CMB can further restrict the mis-
alignment b etween the mantle and core [
Peale et al.
, 2014].
If an inne r core is present, its obliquity angle is de termined by the sum of the torques act-
ing on it. This includes the gravitational torque from the Sun acting on its tilted gure, anal-
ogous to the torque applied on the tilted m antle that sets the obliquity
"
m
. In addition, the
tilt of the inner core also dep ends on the gravitational torque imp osed by the mantle and the
pressure torque at the inner core b oundary (ICB) imp osed by the
uid c ore . If the mantle grav-
itational torque dominate s, the inner c ore tilt is exp ected to remain closely aligned with the
mantle. Conversely, if the pressure torque at the ICB is the largest, the inner core s hould in-
stead b e closely aligned with the spin axis of the
uid core. A strong viscous and/or EM cou-
pling at the ICB should also enforce a closer alignment b etween the rotation vectors of the in-
ner core and
uid core.
It is on the basis of the observed mantle obliquity that the p olar mom ent of inertia of Mer-
cury is inferred [e.g.
Peale
, 1976;
Margot et al.
, 2018]. Inherent in this calculation is the built-
in assumption that the mantle obliquity do es not deviate from that of a rigid planet by a sub-
stantial amount. However, the recent study by
Peale et al.
[2016] suggests that the inner core
can b e m isaligne d from the mantle by a few arcmin and that a large inner core can p e rturb the
orientation of the spin vector of the mantle by as much as 0.1 arcmin. This challe ng es the as-
sumption that the observed obliquity re
ects the orientation of the whole planet.
Furthermore, if a large inner core is misaligned with the mantle, then the mantle spin axis
do es not c oinc ide with the orientation of the p olar moment of inertia of the whole planet. This
can intro duce a systematic o set b etween di erent typ es of obliquity measurements . Those based
on tracking top ographic features [
Margot et al.
, 2007, 2012;
Stark et al.
, 2015a] capture the obliq-
uity of the mantle spin axis. While those based on the orientation of the gravity eld [
Mazarico
et al.
, 2014;
Verma and Margot
, 2016;
Genova et al.
, 2019;
Konopliv et al.
, 2020] are instead
tied to the orientation of the principal moment of inertia of the whole planet. An oset of the
obliquity of the mantle spin axis with re sp ect to the gravity eld could b e used to constrain the
size of the inner core, even though this is dicult to do at prese nt b ecause the di erent esti-
mates of the obliquity of the gravity eld do not match well with one another.

There is thus a signic ant interest in prop erly assessing how the presence of a solid in-
ner core at the centre of Mercury may aect its Cassini state equilibrium. Here, we present a
mo del of Merc ury's Cassini state that comprises a
uid core and s olid inner core. The mo del
is an adaptation of a similar mo del develop ed to study the Cassini state of the Mo on [
Dumb-
erry and Wieczorek
, 2016;
Stys and Dumberry
, 2018;
Organowski and Dumberry
, 2020]. The
sp ecic questions that motivate our study are the following. First, we want to determine how
large the misaligned obliquities of the
uid core and solid inner core can b e and how they de-
p end on mo del parame ters. Second, we want to assess by how much the mantle obliquity may
dier from that of an entirely rigid Mercury, and third, by how much the obliquities of the spin-
symmetry axis of the mantle and gravity eld may dier.

2.1 The interior str uc ture of Mercury
Our mo del of Mercury consists of four layers of uniform density: a solid inner core, a
uid
outer core, a solid mantle, and a thin crust. The oute r radii of each of these layers, are denoted
by
r
s
,
r
f
,
r
m
, and
R
, and the ir densities by
ˆ
s
,
ˆ
f
,
ˆ
m
, and
ˆ
c
, resp ectively. T he inner core ra-
dius
r
s
corresp onds to the ICB radius, the
uid core radius
r
f
to the CMB radius, and
R
=
2439
:
36 km to the planetary radius of Mercury. Compressibility eects from inc reasing pres-
sure with depth are not negligible in the core of Mercury. However adopting uniform densities
simplies the analytical expressions of the mo del while s till capturing the rst order rotational
dynamics. Uniform densities were also adopted by
Peale et a l.
[2016] and following the same
strategy facilitates comparisons b etween our results.
We build our interior mo del as detailed in
Peale et al.
[2016]. We rst sp e cify
r
s
,
ˆ
s
(or
a density contrast at the ICB), the crustal density
ˆ
c
and crustal thickness
h
=
R

r
m
. The
three unknowns
r
f
,
ˆ
f
and
ˆ
m
are then solved such that the interior mo del is consistent with
the known mass
M
and chose n values of the moments of inertia of the whole planet
C
and that
of the mantle and c rus t
C
m
.
Each layer is triaxial in shap e. We denote the p olar
attening (or geometrical ellipticity)
by

i
, dened as the dierence b etween the mean equatorial and p olar radii, divided by the mean
spherical radius. Likewise, we denote the equatorial
attening by the variable
˘
i
, dened as the
dierence b etween the maximum and minimum equatorial radii, divided by the mean spher-
ical radius. As ab ove, we use the subscript
i
=
s
,
f
,
m
and
r
, to denote the p olar or equa-
torial
attenings at the ICB, CMB, crust-mantle b oundary (C rMB), and surface.
The measured p olar and equatorial
attenings are taken from
Perry et al.
[2015] and their
numerical values are given in Table 1. We then assume that the ICB and CMB are b oth at hy-
drostatic equilibrium with the imp osed gravitational p otential induced by the
attenings at the
CrMB and surface. The
attenings at all inte rior b oundaries are sp ecied such that they are
consistent with the observe d degree 2 spherical harmonic co ecients of gravity
J
2
and
C
22
; their
numerical values are given in Table 1. Sp ecically,
J

and
C

are connected to the principal
moments of inertia of Mercury (
C > B > A

The mantle and crust are welded together and form a single rotating region which we re-
fer to as the `mantle' in the context of our rotational mo del. The rotation and symmetry axes
of the mantle are exp ected to remain in close alignment, but they do not coincide exactly. We

To investigate Mercury's resp onse to the gravitational torque from the Sun, we take ad-
vantage of the framework develop ed in
Mathews et al.
[1991] to mo del the forced nutations of
Earth [see also
Mathews et al.
, 2002;
Dehant and Mathews
, 2015]. This mo del takes into ac-
count the pressure torque (also referred to as the inertial torque) that results when the spin axis
of the
uid core is misaligned from the symmetry axes of the elliptical surfaces of the CMB and
ICB. It also includes the gravitational torque e xe rte d on the inner core when it is misaligned
with the mantle. Electromagnetic and viscous torques at b oth the CMB and ICB have b een
incorp orated into the framework [e.g
Buett
, 1992;
Buett et al.
, 2002;
Mathews and Guo
, 2005;
Deleplace and Cardin
, 2006]. The framework was adapted to mo del the Cassini state of the Mo on
in
Dumberry and Wieczorek
[2016] and further develop ed in
Stys and Dumberry
[2018] and
Organowski
and Dumberry
[2020]. We adapt it here to capture the Cassini state of Mercury.
Because the forced precession p erio d is much longer than the rotation and orbital p eri-
o ds of Mercury, the gravitational solar torque that is relevant to the Cassini state is the m ean
torque averaged over one orbit. This mean torque is p erp endicular to the Cassini plane, p oint-
ing in the same direction as the vector connecting the Sun to the des cending no de of Mercury's
orbit in Figure 1. Hence, viewed from the mantle frame, the orientation of this mean torque
is p erio dic, rotating at frequency
!

and

Note that all tilded amplitudes are complex: their imaginary part re

sp onse to the applied torque as a result of dissipation, for instance from viscous or EM coupling
{9{

at the b oundaries of the
uid core. In the absence of dissipation, all tilded variable s are purely
real. We c onc entrate our analysis in this work on the real part of the solutions, which c orre -
sp onds to the mutual alignment of these ve rotation angles in the Cassini plane. As such, ~
"
m
corresp onds to the observed obliquity of the mantle symmetry axis. It is thus equivalent to
"
m
,
though we keep the tilde notation in the presentation of our results to emphasize that it rep-
resents the real part of the solution from our system. Furthermore, since ~

~
"

, we often
refer to ~
"
m
as the orientation of s pin axis of the mantle, since the Cassini state of Mercury is
more custom arily describ ed in terms of the latter in the literature.
The mo del of
Mathews et al.
[1991] is develop ed under the assumption of small angles as
appropriate for the nutations on Earth. The details on how the equations of the mo del are de-
rived can found in
Mathews et al.
[1991] and in
Dumberry and Wieczorek
[2016]. Three equa-
tions describ e, re sp ectively, the time rate of change of the angular momenta of the whole of Mer-
cury, the
uid core, and the inner core in the reference frame of the rotating mantle. These three

Solutions of the homogeneous system (i.e.
y
=
0
) represent free mo des of precession. Three
mo des have p erio ds which, when seen in inertial space, are typically in the range of a few hun-
dred to a few thousand years. The rst is the free axial precession of Mercury maintained by
the solar torque acting on its elliptical gure [e.g.
Peale
, 2005]. The second is the free core nu-
tation (FCN), which is the free precession of the spin axis of the
uid core ab out the symme-
try axis of the CMB [e.g.
Mathews et al.
, 1991]. The third is the free inner core nutation (FICN),
a free mo de of rotation similar to the FCN but asso ciated with the inner core [e.g.
Mathews et al.
,
1991].
A few remarks on our mo del are imp ortant to p oint out b efore we pro ceed further. First,
although we have retaine d the triaxial shap e of Mercury in the expression of the solar torque,
we treat its angular m omentum resp onse as if it we re an axially symm etric b o dy. This is con-
venient as the two equatorial angular momentum equations for each region can b e combined
into a single equation. To rst order, the frequency of the free precession of Mercury is not largely
altered by triaxiality [e.g.
Peale
, 2005].
Baland et al.
[2019] showed that the frequencies of the
FCN and FICN for a triaxial planetary b o dy may b e slightly dierent than those for an axi-
ally symmetric b o dy, but not by large fac tor. As the resp onse of Mercury to the solar torque
is largely determined by the resonant amplication due to the pres ence of these three mo des,
our mo del should capture correctly the rst order Cassini state of Mercury. Considering the
triaxial shap e of Mercury may alter the numerical results, but not our general conclusions.
Second, our mo delling approach is dierent than in the studies of
Peale et al.
[2014] and
Peale et al.
[2016]. In these two studies, dynamical mo dels of Mercury's Cassini state are de-
velop ed and must then b e integrated in time. The equilibrium Cassini state is the quasi-steady
state that remains after transient eects asso ciated with the initial conditions have dec ayed away.
An advantage of the se mo dels compared to ours is that the complete triaxial dynamics of Mer-
cury, including its longitudinal librations, are retained. However, the numerical inte gration can
b e lengthy if dissipation is weak, which restricts the numb er of p ossible interior mo dels of Mer-
cury that can b e tested. I n contrast, our mo del is a sim ple linear system in the frequency do-
main, fo cused on one sp ecic frequency: the forced precession asso ciated with the Cassini state.
Solutions are straightforward to obtain for a give n interior mo del, and this allows us to cover
a larger span of the param eter space. One drawback, however, is that our mo del do es not cap-
ture time-dep endent variations at any other frequencies, including the precession of the p eri-
center of Mercury's orbit ab out the Sun.

These estim ate s are similar to those obtained by
Peale
[2005]. Bec aus e the CMB is elliptical,
the pressure torque exerted on the
uid core by the mantle leads to an entrainment of the
uid
core, the degree of which dep ends on the amplitude of the p ole-to-equator CMB
attening. The
true free precession p erio d lies somewhere b e tween 560 and 1298 yr. Regardless of its exact value,
the free precession p erio d is much shorter than the forcing p erio d of 325 kyr. Using Equation

that for re asonable interior mo dels of Mercury, the FCN and FICN p erio ds are in the range of

3 Results
3.1 Geo detic constraints a nd interior density structure
All our interior mo dels are constrained to match the mass
M
of Mercury and sp ecic choices
of
^
C
=
C =M R
2
and
C
m
=C
. The choice of
^
C
is determined from Equation (28). For the pa-
rameters listed in Table 1, and an observed obliquity of
"
m
= 2
:
04 arcmin [
Margot et al.
, 2012],
this give s
^
C
=
C =M R
2
= 0
:
3455 and all our interior mo dels are consistent with this choice.
Obviously, this re
ects a Cassini state equilibrium in which the
uid core and inner core are
{15{

p erfectly aligned with the mantle, which is not strictly correct. Hence, we make an error in es-
timating
^
C
from Equation (28), or conve rs ely in predicting
"
m
based on a given choice for
^
C
.
Part of the ob jective of our study is to estimate how large this error is. The ratio

For all results presented in our study, the crustal density is set at
ˆ
c
= 2974 kg m

3
[
Sori
,
2018]. Our standard choice for the crustal thickness is
h
= 26 km [
Sori
, 2018], although in
section 3.2 we also present some results with other choices of
h
. We have considered two p os-
sible prescriptions connected to the density of the inner core. First, for all the results presented
in sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, we have used a xed inner core density of
ˆ
s
= 8800 kg m

3
ap-
proximately that obtained in
Dumberry an d Rivoldini
[2015] under the assumption of a pure
Fe comp osition in face -centered cubic phase. This captures an end-memb er scenario where the
core com p osition is an Fe-S alloy; at Mercury's core conditions, crystallization of Fe is relatively
free of S on the Fe-rich side of the eutectic [
Li et al.
, 2001]. If the core comp osition is instead
an Fe-Si alloy, approximately equal partitioning of Si b etween the liquid and solid phase [e.g.
Schaefer et al.
, 2017] implies a weak chemical contrast at the ICB. The density jump across the
ICB is exp ected to b e sm all, although since density increases with depth, the contrast b etween
the mean densities of the
uid and solid cores is larger. It is these mean densities that enter
our Mercury mo del with uniform density layers. To capture this other end-memb er core com-
p osition scenario, in section 3.5 we present results where we instead prescrib e a xed density
contrast b etween the
uid and solid core; sp e cically, we set the numerical value of

For a given choice of inner core radius
r

(

vary as a function of in-
ner core radius
r
s
for each of the two inner core density sc enarios : a xed

3

the inner core is small, its presence has a limited in
uence on the resulting density structure,
and we nd

,
ˆ
f
= 7263 kg m

3
and
r
f
= 2000 km in each of the two
scenarios. Whe n
ˆ
s
is xed to 8800 kg m

3
, as the inner core reaches 1500 km in size,
r
f
in-
creases to ab ove 2100 km,
ˆ
m
approaches 4000 kg m

3
and
ˆ
f
is reduced to b elow 5000 kg m

3
.
Figure 3a illustrates that when adopting a xed
ˆ
s
, there is a limit in the p ossible inner core
size, as otherwise
ˆ
m
gets unreasonably large and
ˆ
f
gets inappropriately sm all (as it would
require an excessively large concentration of light elements). When adopting instead a xed den-
sity contrast, with

:
1, the changes in
r
f
,
ˆ
m
and
ˆ
f
with inner core radius are more mo d-
est, allowing larger p ossible inner core sizes. Dierent assumptions on

would alte r the
numerical values shown on Figure 3a but not their trends with

to 100 yr (160 yr) for a small inne r core and dec reasing to approximately 40 yr (120 yr) at the
largest

under the xed

from it that we do not exp ect large ~

a free motion in inertial space thereby a ecting the free rotational mo des. To a go o d approx-

This frequency is slightly die re nt from the usual expression for Earth, involving the ratio

A=

. This is b ecause of the relatively thin mantle of Mercury; for the largest
r
s
considered, the moment of inertia of the inner core can ge t close to 40% of that of the man-
tle and is not negligible. The p erio d of the FCN when only interior torques contribute is shown
in Figure 3b. It is close to 1100 yr for a small inner core, increasing to approximately 1500 yr
at the largest
r
s
. Hence , the in
uence of the solar torque reduces the FCN p erio d by a factor
of approximately 3. We note that the FICN p erio d, in contrast, is not altered substantially when
the external torque is set to zero.
3.2 Gravitational and inertial coupling
Let us now investigate the obliquities of the mantle,
uid core and inner core in the ir equi-
librium Cassini state. We assume a xed inner c ore density sce nario in this section, with
ˆ
s
=
8800 kg m

3
. Visc ous and EM coupling are set to zero in order to isolate the in
uence of grav-
itational and ine rtial coupling. Figure 4 shows how ~
"
m
, ~
m
f
and ~
n
s
vary as functions of inner
core radius. We show calculations for three dierent choices of crustal thickness, but let us con-
centrate rst on the case for
h
= 26 km. For s mall
r
s
, we retrieve an obliquity of ~
"
m
= 2
:
0494
arcmin (Figure 4a). ~
"
m
decreases w ith
r
s
, but not substantially; at the largest
r
s
(1500 km),
~
"
m
= 2
:
0460 arcmin, a decrease of 0.0034 arcmin. The maximum di erence from ~
"
m
= 2
:
04
arcmin, the obliquity that we used in setting the constraint for
^
C
{ and hence the prediction
we should recover for a rigid plane t { is an overestimate of approximately 0
:
01 arcmin which
o ccurs for s mall inner cores.
The deviation of ~
"
m
from that of a rigid planet is due to the misalignments of the
uid
core ( ~
m
f
) and solid inner core ( ~
n
s
) with resp ect to the mantle (Figure 4b). The misalignment
of the
uid core spin axis from the m antle is signicant: ~
m
f
is approximate ly 4.02 arcmin for
a small inner core and do es not vary substantially with inner core size; it drops to 3.97 arcmin
at the largest
r
s
. Recall that ~
m
f
is measured with resp ect to the mantle rotation axis (which
coincides close ly with the sym metry axis), so the obliquity of the spin axis of the
uid core with
resp ect to the orbit normal is ~
"
m
+ ~
m
f
ˇ
6 arcmin. The reason why the obliquity of the spin
axis of the
uid core is larger than that of the mantle can b e understo o d from Equation (32b),
which shows that ~
m
f
is determined by the re sonant amplication of the FCN m o de at the forc-
ing frequency. When the FCN frequency is much larger than the forcing frequency, as is the
case for Mercury, the resonant amplic ation is very weak but re mains present and ~
m
f
is larger
than zero.
In contrast to ~
m
f
, the misalignment of the inner core with resp ect to the mantle is much
smaller; ~
n
s
is approximately b etween 0.023-0.025 arcmin, a factor 80 times s maller than ~
"
m
.
Physically, this is b ecause the gravitational torque acting on the inner core when it is tilted from
the mantle is much stronger than the inertial torque ac ting at the ICB . As a result, the inner
core must remain in close alignment with the mantle. Presented dierently, since the FICN p e-
rio d is more than 3000 times shorter than the forced precession p erio d, the inne r core can eas-

3.3 Viscous coupling
We now investigate how viscous coupling at the CMB and ICB aects the equilibrium Cassini
state.
Peale et al.
[2014] present two dierent parameterizations of viscous coupling base d on
the timesc ale of attenuation of the dierential rotation b etween the
uid core and mantle. More
complete analytical solutions for the
ow resulting from a dierentially pre cessing shell have
b een derived [e.g.
Stewartson and Roberts

Busse

Rochester

these solutions here. The param etrization of the visc ous coupling constants

larger than our estimate for Mercury ab ove. Since the eective turbulent coupling constant

cury should b e smaller. Thus,

is reduced. With the reduced dierential velo city at the CMB, the prediction

The inclusion of viscous coupling at the ICB can lead to a substantial change in inner c ore
tilt. A larger viscosity leads to stronger viscous coupling and to a closer alignment of the in-
ner core with the
uid core spin axis. The viscous coupling strength is inversely prop ortional
to
r
s
, so a larger viscosity results in a larger inner c ore radius at which viscous coupling is of
a similar magnitude to gravitational coupling. Taking again an upp er b ound of

, Figure 5 indicates that ~
n
s
may b e 1 arcmin or larger only if the inner core radius is
smaller than approximately 100 km . For an inner core of a few hundred km in radius, gravi-
tational coupling is much larger than viscous coupling, and the inner core tilt is limited to a
fraction of 1 arcmin.
The larger inner core tilt observed with increasing eective visc osity results in a larger
oset b etween the obliquity of the principal moment of ine rtia ~
"
g
and that of the mantle ~

,
though it remains limited. For the upp er b ound of

The conclusion that emerges from Figure 5 is that the larger the inner core is, the smaller
the misalignments of b oth the
uid core and inner core are w ith resp ect to the mantle. This
implies that the larger the inner core is, the more we approach a planet precessing as a rigid
b o dy, although the misalignment of the spin axis of the
uid core remains imp ortant, approx-
imately 3-4 arcmin away from the mantle symmetry axis. The sp ecic way in which ~

m

and ~
n

change with inner core size would c ertainly b e dierent for a turbulent mo del of viscous
coupling. But the general conclusion remains that the addition of viscous coupling at the CMB

3.4 Electromagnetic coupling
Let us now turn to electromagnetic (EM) coupling. To fo cus on its role in the equilibrium
Cassini state, we se t the viscous coupling back to zero. Because magnetic eld lines tend to re-
main attached to electrically conducting materials, a dierential tangential motion b etween two
electrically conducting regions stretches existing magnetic eld lines that thread their interface.
This induces a secondary magnetic eld (or equivalently, an electrical current) and an asso ci-
ated tangential EM stress resisting the dierential motion. EM coupling at the CMB and ICB
acts then in a similar way to viscous coupling, and this 'magnetic friction' dep ends on the strength
of the radial magnetic eld
B
r
and the electrical conductivity
˙
on either side of the b ound-
ary [
Rochester
, 1960, 1962, 1968].
The parametrization of EM coupling in terms of the coupling constants
K

EM coupling c an b e enhanced if strongly stratied p o ckets of core

smaller by a factor
˘
60 than the smallest p ossible visc ous coupling constant. Viscous forces
dominate the tangential stress on the CMB of Mercury.
At the ICB, b ecause we can exp ect the electrical conductivity in b oth the solid inner core
and
uid c ore to b e similar, and b ecause the radial magnetic eld is likely much stronger, EM
coupling can b e much large r and dominate viscous coupling. We assume that the magnetic eld
morphology at the ICB is dominantly comprised of small spatial s cales for example as predicted
by the dynamo mo del of
Christensen
[2006]. EM coupling in this case can b e parametrized in
terms of an equivalent uniform radial magnetic eld
h
B
r
i
capturing its r.m.s. strength [
Buf-
fett et al.
, 2002;
Dumberry and Koot
, 2012]. Assuming an electrical conductivity
˙
equal in the

uid and s olid core, the c oupling constant
K

can b e written in the form
K
icb

o
) is the magnetic skin depth. As
F
icb
is inversely prop ortional to
r
s
,
K
icb
is inversely prop ortional to inner core size. Note that computing the EM coupling based
on the r.m.s. strength
h
B
r
i
rather than a true eld morphology tends to overestimate the strength
of the coupling [
Koot and Dumberry
, 2013]. However, since the s tre ngth of the radial magnetic
eld at the ICB of Mercury is largely unknown, imp erfections of the EM coupling mo del are
absorb ed in the range of p ossible
h
B
r
i
values.
The parametrization of Equation (50) is only valid in a 'weak eld' regime [
Buett et al.
,
2002], when the feedback from the Lorentz force on the
ow in the
uid core c an b e neglected.
When
h
B

is suciently large, this is no longer the case. EM coupling then enters a 'strong
eld' regime [
Buett et al.

Dumberry and Koot

Koot and Dumberry

K

Mercury remains in the weak eld regime.

is reduced not b ecause of
EM coupling at the CMB, but rather from the combination of EM coupling at the ICB, which
pulls the

inner core, which pulls the latter to align with the mantle. The larger the EM coupling is, the
greater is the reduction in ~

The larger the inner core is, the smaller are the misalignments of the
uid and solid cores
with resp ect to the mantle. Hence, the general conclusion we reached for viscous coupling alone
is not altered with the addition of EM coupling but further strengthened; the larger the inner
core is, the closer we approach a planet precessing as a rigid b o dy. This is b est revealed by the
obliquity of the gravity eld ~

which, for a large inner core, asymptotically approaches the obliq-
uity exp ected for a rigid planet. Note that with strong EM coupling at the ICB, the oset b e-

for the Cassini state equilibrium of Mercury, the tangential stress at the CMB is dominated by
viscous forces, and that at the ICB should b e dominated by EM forces. To simplify, we con-

vary with inner core radius for the 'represe ntative'

sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4. Figure 7 also shows how the results change when, for the same rep-
resentative coupling mo del, we adopt instead a xed density contrast b etween the
uid and solid
cores and for dierent choices of

3
(coloured lines). For a relatively high density contrast (

:

3
, the p oint at which the orientation of the co-precessing
uid and inner cores b e gins to b e
pulled into an alignment with the mantle is pushed to a larger inner core radius. However, the
general b ehaviour of ~
"
m
, ~
m
f
and ~
n
s
as functions of inner core radius is unchanged. Hence, all
our results in the previous thre e sections would b e qualitatively similar under a xed de ns ity
contrast scenario. A smaller density contrast at the ICB only implies that a larger inner core
is required in order to pro duce an equivalent change in the Cassini state equilibrium.
4 Discussion
The study of
Peale et a l.
[2016] also presented predictions of the obliquities of the man-
tle,
uid core and inner core asso ciated with the equilibrium Cassini state of Mercury. Their
mo del included the tangential viscous stress at the ICB and CMB, but not the EM stress. Their

obtain b etween a case with no inner core and an inner core radius equal to 0.6 times the plan-

1463 km, close to the maximum inner core size of 1500 km we have considered),
is approxim ately an increase of 5


rad = 0.17 arcmin. This also corresp onds approxi-
mately to the deviation of the obliquity with resp ect to that of a rigid planet.
When only vis cous stress is included in our mo del (section 3.3), our results are substan-
tially dierent. As illustrated in Figure 4, we nd instead that the obliquity of the
uid core
gets sm aller with inner core size and that the change is very mo dest. In contrast with the re-
sults of
Peale et al.
[2016], we nd that the inner core obliquity is typically smaller than that
of the
uid core, except when the inner core is ve ry small or whe n the eective viscosity is un-
reasonably large. We also nd that as the inner core size is increased, the m antle obliquity gets
smaller, opp osite to the results of
Peale et a l.
[2016], and that the changes remain small, at most
of the order of 0.005 arcmin. A part of the dierence is due to the dierent visc ous coupling
mo del that we use. But even when we adopt their mo del parameters and use their viscosity mo del,
we were not able to repro duce their results.
In the absence of viscous and EM coupling, the strong gravitational torque exerted on the
inner core by the mantle should prevent any large misalignment b etween the two. This is cap-
tured by the p erio d of the FICN, which is of the order of 100 yr, much shorter than the forc-
ing p erio d of 325 kyr. Viscous and/or EM coupling at the ICB can counteract the gravitational
torque (and alter the p erio d of the FICN), but only for a small inner core. The ratio of the visc ous -
EM torque to the gravitational torque decreases with inner core size , so a large inner core should
b e more strongly aligned with the mantle. The more strongly the inner core and mantle are
{27{
Condential manuscript submitted to
JGR-Planets
gravitationally lo cked together, the more they b ehave as a single rigid b o dy in resp onse to the
external torque from the Sun. We exp ect then that the obliquity of the mantle should b e brought
closer to that of a rigid planet when the inner core is larger. Hence, we nd puzz ling the re-
sults of
Peale et al.
[2016], which suggest the opp osite.
We showe d that EM coupling is most likely larger than viscous coupling at the ICB, even
though our knowledge of the radial magnetic eld strength inside Mercury (on which EM cou-
pling dep ends) remains p o or. If the magnetic eld strength at the ICB is ab ove 0.3 mT, EM
coupling is suciently strong to bring the
uid and solid cores into a lo cked pro cession motion.
The larger the inner core is, the more this co-precessing core is forced into an alignment with
the mantle b ecause of the mantle gravitational torque on the inner core. As a result, the larger
the inner core is, the closer we approach a situation resembling a whole planet precessing as
a rigid b o dy. The addition of EM coupling at the ICB do es not change the overall picture that
we observe with viscous coupling alone; the mantle obliquity decreases with inne r core size. The
amplitude of the decrease can b e as large as 0.015 arcmin, 3 times larger than for viscous cou-
pling alone; this remains a factor 10 smaller than the changes suggested in
Peale et al.
[2016],
and again, imp ortantly, in the reverse direction.
Our results suggest then that the presence and size of an inner core leads to only mo d-
est changes of the mantle obliquity
"
m
compared to the obliquity predicted on the basis of an
entirely rig id planet (
"
r
m
). Let us denote this dierence as 
"
m

"
r
m
. The largest 
"
m
o ccurs for a small or no inner core, and is 
"
m
ˇ
0
:
01 arcmin. This dierence is decreased
as the inner core size is increased. For a suciently large inner core, in the case of a strong EM
coupling and large density contrast at the ICB, 
"
m
can b e negative, but its absolute value
remains smaller than 0.01 arcmin.
To put these results in p ersp ective, the uncertainty in the measurement of the mantle obliq-
uity re p orted by
Margot et al.
[2012] and
Stark et al.
[2015a] is of the order of 0.08 arcmin, much
larger than this dierence. This means that, at the current level of precis ion, it is not p os si-
ble to distinguish the p osition of the mantle obliquity from the obliquity of a rigid planet. This
is consiste nt with the fact that the observed obliquity falls close to that exp ected from a rigid
planet. But it also implies that the observed obliquity cannot b e used to place constraints on
the inner core size.
Nevertheless, our results show that the pres ence of a
uid core and inner core aect the
resulting mantle obliquity by as much as 0.01 arcmin. This is of the same order as the change
in obliquity caused by elastic tidal deformation, which is of the order of 0.35 arcsec (
ˇ
0
:
006
arcmin) [
Baland et al.
, 2017]. This is also of the same order as the amplitude of the nutation
motion ab out the mean equilibrium Cassini state forced by the precession of the p ericenter, which
is approxim ately 0.85 arcsec (
ˇ
0
:
014 arcmin) [
Baland et al.
, 2017]. The precision on the obliq-
uity from the up coming BepiColomb o satellite mission is exp e cted to b e

0
:
5 arcsec (

0
:
008
arcmin) [
Cicalo et al.
, 2016]. Thus, in addition to including tidal deformation and the preces-
sion of the p ericenter, a Cassini state mo del that includes a
uid and solid core will then b e
necessary in order to prop erly tie Mercury's obliquity to its interior struc ture . In turn, this op e ns
the p ossibility of further constraining the interior structure of Mercury on the basis of its obliq-
uity.
Obliquity measureme nts based on tracking top ographic features re
ect the orientation of
the spin-symmetry axis of the mantle (
"
m
). Measureme nts based on tracking the gravity eld
of Mercury re
ect instead the orientation of the principal moment of the whole planet (
"
g
). These
two orientations do not coincide when an inner core is present and is misaligned from the man-
tle. Since gravitational coupling prevents a large inner core tilt with resp ect to the mantle, we
{28{

nd that the misalignment 

is limited. The maximum oset that we obtain
is approxim ately 

light of the recent obliquity of the gravity eld estimated in
Genova et al.
[2019],
"
g

Margot et al.

"
m
=


0
:
085 arcmin [
Stark et al.
, 2015a], although all three measurements remain consistent
with one another within their error estimates. In their interpretation,
Genova et al.
[2019] sug-
gest that the dierent central value of the obliquity that they obtain (smaller by
˘
0
:
07 ar-
cmin) is p e rhaps explained by an oset 
"
g
due to the presence of a (p ossibly large) solid in-
ner core. However, this is one order of mag nitude larger than the maximum magnitude of 
"
g
that we predict. Moreover, we predict that the obliquity of the gravity eld should b e larger
than that of the mantle spin axis, not smaller. Hence, at the present-day level of the precision
of the measurements,
"
g
and
"
m
should coincide, and their dierence cannot b e interpreted as
re
ecting the misalignment b etween the p olar moment of inertia of the whole planet and the
mantle spin axis.
Lastly, we have concentrated our eorts on the mutual orientations of the dierent spin
and symmetry axes in the Cassini plane. Diss ipation at the CMB and ICB intro duced by vis-
cous and EM coupling also lead to a displace ment of these axes in the direction p erp endicu-
lar to the Cassini plane [e.g
Peale et al.
, 2014]. Indeed, the two measurements based on track-
ing surface top ographic features from
Margot et al.
[2012] and
Stark et al.
[2015a] suggest that
the mantle spin axis lags b ehind the Cassini plane by approxima te ly 2 arcsec (
˘
0
:
03 arcmin).
Although this oset is smaller than the measureme nt errors, so that the observed obliquity is
still consistent with no deviation away from the Cas sini plane, some amount of dissipation in-
variably takes place. These measurements give the n a measure of the p ossible amplitude of the
dissipation. One source of dissipation is from anelastic tidal deformation [
Baland et al.
, 2017],
but viscous and EM coupling at the b oundaries of the
uid core is another. Hence, the out-of-
plane comp onent of the observe d obliquity may further help to quantify and constrain the in-
terior coupling mechanisms. This will b e the sub ject of a future study.
5 Conclusion
We have investigated how the presence of a
uid core and solid inner core aects the Cassini
state equilibrium of Mercury. Our general conclusion is that the coupling strength b etween Mer-
cury's inte rior regions is s u ciently strong that the obliquity of the mantle spin-symmetry axis
do es not deviate from that of a rigid planet by more than 0.01 arcmin. This largest oset o c-
curs for a small or no inner core. The larger the inner core is, the more it is forced into an align-
ment with the mantle b ecause of the strong gravitational torque b etween the two, and the closer
we approach a situation resembling a whole planet precessing as a rigid b o dy. The misalign-
ment b etween the p olar moment of ine rtia and mantle spin axis increases with inner core size,
but is limited to approximately 0.007 arcmin. The se conclusions apply irres p ective of the core
comp osition and thus of the partitioning of light elem ents into the solid core; a smaller den-
sity contrast at the ICB only implies that a larger inner core is required in order to pro duce
an equivalent change in the Cass ini state equilibrium.
Our results imply that the obliquities of the mantle spin axis and p olar moment of iner-
tia (or, equivalently, the gravity eld) should coincide at the present-day level of measureme nt
errors. Moreover, neither of these can b e distinguished from the obliquity predicted on the ba-
sis of a rigid planet. However, the smaller me asure ment errors exp ected from the up coming Bepi-
Columb o satellite mission may p ermit this distinction, and thus provide further constraints on
Mercury's inte rior structure.
