ABSTRACT
Recent hydrodynamical simulations of convection in a solar-like model suggest that penetrative convective ows at the boundary
of the convective envelope modify the thermal background in the overshooting layer. Based on these results, we implement in one-
dimensional stellar evolution codes a simple prescription to modify the temperature gradient below the convective boundary of a
solar model. This simple prescription qualitatively reproduces the behaviour found in the hydrodynamical simulations, namely a
local heating and smoothing of the temperature gradient below the convective boundary. We show that introducing local heating in
the overshooting layer can reduce the sound-speed discrepancy usually reported between solar models and the structure of the Sun
inferred from helioseismology. It also a

ects key quantities in the convective envelope, such as the density, the entropy, and the
speed of sound. These e

ects could help reduce the discrepancies between solar models and observed constraints based on seismic
inversions of the Ledoux discriminant. Since mixing due to overshooting and local heating are the result of the same convective
penetration process, the goal of this work is to invite solar modellers to consider both processes for a more consistent approach.

1. Introduction
Modelling the internal structure of the Sun is still a challenge.
A recent review by Christensen-Dalsgaard (2021) describes in
detail the long-standing e

orts to improve solar models. The so-
lar modelling problem refers to the discrepancy between helio-
seismology and solar interior models that adopt low metallici-
ties predicted by the three-dimensional (3D) atmosphere models
of, for example, Asplund et al. (2009) and Ca

au et al. (2011),
in contrast to the high metallicities based on previous litera-
ture compilations by, for example, Anders & Grevesse (1989)
and Grevesse & Noels (1993). Asplund et al. (2021) have re-
cently conrmed with state-of-the-art 3D simulations the rela-
tively low metal abundances for the Sun. Asplund et al. (2021)
consider that their study yields the most reliable solar abun-
dances available today, suggesting that the solar modelling prob-
lem is no longer a problem of abundances but rather a problem
of stellar physics. The treatment of mixing below the convective
zone is one of the key processes that could improve solar mod-
els. Several studies indeed reveal that the process of convective
penetration, also called overshooting, at the bottom of the con-
vective envelope could play an important role in improving the
agreement between solar models and helioseismic constraints
(see for example Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. 2011; Zhang et al.
2012; Buldgen et al. 2019b). Overshooting in solar models has
most often been treated using di

usive or instantaneous chemi-
cal mixing. A temperature gradient that sharply transitions from
a nearly adiabatic form to a radiative form is usually assumed,
as suggested by the theoretical work of Zahn (1991). Models
with a smoother transition have also been investigated. Based
on the analysis of models with di

erent stratications near the

e
base of the convective zone, Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. (2011)
found that models that better t the helioseismic data have a
weakly sub-adiabatic temperature gradient in the lower part of
the convective zone and a smooth transition to the radiative gra-
dient in the overshooting layer. But Christensen-Dalsgaard et al.
(2011) noted that the required tempe rature stratication is di

-
cult to reconcile with existing overshooting models and numer-
ical simulations. They concluded that only non-local turbulent
convection models could produce the desired degree of smooth-
ness in the transition (see for example Zhang & Li 2012; Zhang
et al. 2012). But these non-local models remain uncertain, and
their description of overshooting under the conditions found at
the base of the solar convective zone is yet to be validated.
Zhang et al. (2019) explored the impact of overshooting by
introducing a parametrised turbulent kinetic energy ux based
on a model with parameters that are adjusted to improve the
helioseismic properties. They suggest that amelioration can be
obtained specically below the convective envelope. However,
Zhang et al. (2019) nd that this model cannot solve the whole
solar problem because such a ux worsens the sound-speed pro-
le in the deep radiative interior of their solar model. Given the
uncertainties regarding the temperature stratication of the over-
shooting region, solar modellers have con sidered these e

ects as
secondary and have focused their e

orts on exploring the impact
of solar abundances, microphysics (opacities, equations of state,
nuclear reaction rates), and chemical mixing and di

usion (see
details and references in the review of Buldgen et al. 2019a).
Additional, more exotic e

ects such as early disk accretion or
solar-wind mass loss (Zhang et al. 2019; Kunitomo & Guillot
2021) are also attracting increasing attention.
To reinvigorate the debate, Buldgen et al. (2019b) recently
highlighted once again how the transition of the temperature gra-

e et al.: Local heating due to convective overshooting and the solar modelling problem
dient just below the convective envelope can signicantly impact
the disagreement between solar models and helioseismic con-
straints. Their results, based on a method that combines multi-
ple structural inversions, suggest that the transition in temper-
ature gradient is improperly reproduced by adopting either an
adiabatic or a radiative temperature gradient in the overshoot-
ing layer. The solution should be somewhere in between these
two extremes. Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. (2018) also note that
an increase in the temperature at the transition would remove
a remaining small sharp dip in the speed of sound immediately
beneath the convective zone of the model. A major di

culty is
to disentangle the e

ects of overshoot from the e

ects of opaci-
ties, which can also alter the temperature gradient in these layers.
Given the large number of parameters to deal with in order to im-
prove solar models and the current lack of strong arguments in
favour of modifying the thermal stratication in the overshoot-
ing layer, there has been no real motivation to deviate from the
traditional picture of a sharp transition as formalised by Zahn
(1991).
The present work is motivated by arguments inspired by hy-
drodynamical simulations of convection and convective penetra-
tion in solar-like models. Recent hydrodynamical simulations by
Bara

e et al. (2021, hereafter B21) highlight the process of local
heating in the overshooting region due to penetrating convective
motions across the convective boundary. In the following, we
analyse the potential impact of this feature on one-dimensional
(1D) stellar evolution structures in the context of solar models.
The hydrodynamical results of B21 are briey summarised in
Sect. 2, and their impact on 1D models are analysed in Sect. 3
and discussed in Sect. 4.
2. Modication of the thermal background in the
overshooting layer: Results from
two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations
B21 performed two-dimensional (2D) fully compressible time-
implicit simulations of convection and convective penetration in
a solar-like model with the MUlti-dimensional Stellar Implicit
Code MUSIC (Viallet et al. 2011, 2016; Go

rey et al. 2017).
The main motivation was to explore the impact of an articial
increase in the stellar luminosity on the properties of convection
and convective penetration. This procedure is a common tactic
adopted in hydrodynamical simulations of convection (Rogers
et al. 2006; Meakin & Arnett 2007; Brun et al. 201 1; Hotta 2017;
Edelmann et al. 2019). The experiments of B21 highlight the im-
pact of penetrative downows on the local thermal background
in the overshooting layer. They illustrate how convective down-
ows, when penetrating the region below the convective bound-
ary of the envelope, can induce a local heating and a modication
of the temperature gradient as a result of compression and shear
in the overshooting layer. This modication of the local back-
ground is connected to a local increase in the radiative ux to
counterbalance the negative enthalpy ux (o r heat ux) produced
by penetrating ows. The negative peak of the enthalpy ux
and the positive bump of the radiative ux below the convective
boundary are well-known features described in many numeri-
cal works (Hurlburt et al. 1986; Muthsam et al. 1995; Brummell
et al. 2002; Brun et al. 2011; Hotta 2017; K
Â¨
apyl
Â¨
a 2019; Cai
2020). A few works (Rogers et al. 2006; Viallet et al. 2013; Korre
et al. 2019; Higl et al. 2021) have also reported a modication
of the local thermal backgroun d in the overshooting region, but
without providing a detailed description. The simulations of B21
provide a physical explanation that links the convective penetra-
tion process to the local heating and to the radiative bump in the
overshooting layer. The solar-like star simulated in B21 is based
on a model that is not thermally relaxed. It is reaso nable to as-
sume that the local heating seen in B21 is present in stars because
the negative heat ux in the overshooting layer and the bump in
the radiative ux that compensates for this feature are persistent.
These two features are also commonly observed in other hydro-
dynamical simulations, as mentioned above. An exploration of
the impact of this heating on stellar evolution models may reveal
that heating is a necessary aspect of models for overshooting.

features are intensied in these `boosted' models (upper panel).

in Fig. 1, the temperature gradient becomes less sub-adiabatic
immediately below the convective boundary

. The net result is
a smoother transition just below the convective boundary with
a temperature gradient that has an intermediate value between
the radiative temperature gradient and the adiabatic one. In the
next section we analyse the impact of this local heating on 1D
solar structures by adopting a simple prescription that mimics
the behaviour of the temperature gradient suggested by hydro-
dynamical simulations.

models
3.1. Helioseismic constraints
Our primary goal in this short paper is to illustrate the potential,
qualitative impact of the local heating produced by overshoot-
ing. We adopted a strategy inspired by the analysis of Buldgen
et al. (2020), who constructed a static structure of the Sun in
agreement with seismic inversions of the Ledoux discriminant

. Starting from a reference evolu-
tionary model, Buldgen et al. (2020) used an inversion pro-
cedure to iteratively reconstruct a solar model. Successive in-
versions of the Ledoux discriminant allowed them to obtain a
model-independent prole for this quantity. Their reconstruction
method also gives solar structures that are in excellent agree-
ment with other structural inversions, namely the entropy,
S
, the
square of the speed of soun d,
c
2
s
, and the density,
Ë†
. To illustrate
the convergence of their reconstruction procedure, they show
(right panels of their Figs. 3-6) the successive iterations that con-
verge to an excellent level of agreement for the four structural
inversions (

S
,
c

) starting from the initial reference model
adopted in their work. The di

erences found between the recon-
structed model and the reference model are useful as they indi-
cate the modications of the reference model that are required to
converge towards a solar model in agreement with helioseismic
data. We recall here the major trends found by Buldgen et al.
(2020) for the four structural quantities, which are used for our
analysis in Sect. 3.2.
The rst concerns the Ledoux discriminant. The major dis-
crepancy between the Sun and the reference model occurs just
below the convective boundary, with a large positive bump for
the quantity (
A

-
A
ref
).
The second concerns the speed of sound. The same positive
bump at the same location as for the Ledoux discriminant,
A

observed for the quantity (

. The corrections
applied to

during the reconstruction procedure also reduce the
discrepancy in the speed of sound in the radiative region.
The third concerns the entropy. Large discrepancies are ob-
served in both the radiative region and the convective zone. The

has two positive peaks in
the radiative zone, one just below the overshooting region and a
larger peak deeper at
Ë˜
40% of the stellar radius. This discrep-
ancy is negative in the convective zone. The corrections applied
to
A
help reduce these entropy discrepancies in both regions.
The fourth concerns the density. The quantity (

has a negative peak in the radiative region, at

of the stellar radius, and is positive in the convective zone.
Importantly, Buldgen et al. (2020) mention that their recon-
struction procedure gives similar Ledoux discriminant proles
for a wide range of initial reference models. We used these re-
sults to gauge whether the modications of the thermal prole
predicted by B21 can help in qualitatively improving all the
structural quantities used by Buldgen et al. (2020).
3.2. Testing one-dimensional solar models
Our main motivation is to show the potential impact of the local
heating described in Sect. 2 on stellar models. We are not aim-
ing in this short work at constructing the best solar model to t
helioseismic constraints. Using stellar evolution codes, we have
adopted two di

erent methods that can be found in the litera-
ture to construct solar models (e.g. Zhang et al. 2012; Vinyoles
et al. 2017). Our rst method relies on the thermal relaxation
of a reference model with solar radius and luminosity that is
modied to reproduce the temperature gradient in the overshoot-
ing layer suggested by hydrodynamical simulations. In this case,
the chemical abundances are not modied by nuclear reactions,
mixing, or microscopic di

usion during the relaxation process.
For these tests, we used the 1D Lyon stellar evolution code
(Bara

e et al. 1998). We repeated this experiment based on ther-
mal relaxation with the stellar evolution code MONSTAR (e.g.
Constantino et al. 2014) and obtained the same qualitative re-
sults.
The second method considers models that account for the
modication of the temperature gradient in th e overshooting
layer from the zero age main sequence (ZAMS). The models
are then evolved until they reach the solar radius and luminosity.
With this approach, changes in the chemical abundances from
nuclear reactions, microscopic di

usion, and overshooting mix-
ing are also consistent with any modication of the structure
induced by the forced local heating in the overshooting layer.
These tests were performed with MONSTAR as it includes the
treatment of microscopic di

usion.
The rst method allows the impact of local heating in
the overshooting layer after thermal relaxation to be isolated.
The second method provides evolutionary models that are self-
consistent since the e

ect of the modication of the temperature
gradient is accounted for during their evolution on the main se-
quence.
In the following, we adopt a modication of the local temper-
ature gradient in the overshooting layer that qualitatively repro-
duces the behaviour displayed in Fig. 1. We dene an overshoot-
ing length

Sine functions are used in Eqs. (3) and (5) to reproduce the
smooth variations in the temperature gradient below the convec-
tive bo undary produced by the hydrodynamical simulations. We
have veried that the results are insensitive to the smoothness of
these variations and to the exact shape of the temperature gra-
dient radial prole.We adopted
a
=
0.3 in Eq. (3) as it provides a
behaviour for the temperature gradient very close to the one dis-
played in Fig. 1. Results are rather insensitive to variations in the
values of
a
between 0.2 and 0.4. We adopted
b
=
0.03 in Eq. (5),
which also provides a close visual match to the hydrodynamical
results, but we note that the results are insensitive to the value of
b
.
3.2.1. Ther mal equilibr ium models
The details of the procedure for the rst method are the follow-
ing. We calculate the evolution of a 1
M

model with an initial
helium mass fraction of 0.28, metallicity
Z
=
0
:
02
;
and a mix-
ing length
l
mix
=
1
:
9
H
P
. We use a reference model that is in
thermal equilibrium
2
and has the luminosity and radius of the
current Sun. Starting from this reference model, the tempera-
ture gradient is modied over a prescribed depth to mimic the
impact of overshooting according to the hydrodynamical sim-
ulations described in Sect. 2. We adopt the prescription given
by Eqs. (2)-(5) over a distance
d
ov
below the convective bound-
ary. We show the results in Fig. 2 for

ov
=
0.15 and

ov
=
0.20.
These overshooting widths are in good agreement with the maxi-
mal depth reached by downows below the convective boundary
predicted by the hydrodynamical simulations for the solar-like
model investigated in B21. We note that the stellar model used
in B21 is slightly under-luminous compared to the Sun (see B21
for details). B21 also mention that one should be cautious when
directly applying the overshooting depths predicted by their sim-
ulations to real stars since the nal relaxed state for these simula-
tions may have di

erent properties from non-thermally relaxed
states. We varied

ov
between 0.15 and 0.35 and nd that the
results do not change qualitatively. However, the amplitude of
the variations in the model properties depends on
d
ov
(see be-
low). As shown below, this simple prescription implemented in
a stellar evolution code yields a local increase in the tempera-
ture below the convective boundary, similar to that observed in
the hydrodynamical simulations. We stress that Eqs. (2)-(5) have
been chosen for simplicity. They are only a rough approximation
that can mimic the thermal prole behaviour suggested in the 2D
simulations.
The model with a modied temperature gradient is then ther-
mally relaxed, that is to say, it is evolved over many thermal
timescales without any modication of the abundances from nu-
clear reactions until thermal equilibrium is reached. The temper-
ature gradient is modied in the overshooting layer during the
whole relaxation process, and this is referred to as a `forced local
heating'. This procedure ensures that the model with a modied
temperature gradient can be consistently compared to the refer-
ence model. As shown in Fig. 2, the simple prescription given
2
Thermal equilibrium means that the total nuclear energy produced
in the central regions balances the radiative losses at the surface,
i.e.
the
total nuclear luminosity,
L
nuc
, equals the total stellar luminosity,
L
.
by Eqs. (2)-(5) yields similar qualitative changes in the temper-
ature and the sub-adiabaticity close to the convective boundary
that was found in the hydrodynamical simulations of B21.

The impact on the whole stellar structure was quantied by
comparing the four structural quantities (

such a modication of the temperature gradient is expected to
improve the agreement with helioseismic constraints and help
4
Bara

e et al.: Local heating due to convective overshooting and the solar modelling problem
remove the sound speed anomaly below the convective bound-
ary (second trend in Sect. 3.1), as suggested by the results of
Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. (2011). But it is also interesting to
note that such a modicatio n yields a slight cooling of the con-
vective zone (see Fig. 2) and thus a negative di

erence for the
entropy (see Fig. 3). A negative di

erence in the convective en-
velope is in agreement with the correction required for the ref-
erence model of Buldgen et al. (2020) to better match the Sun
(see third trend in Sect. 3.1). Regarding the density, the modi-
cation of the temperature gradient has an interesting impact in
the radiative zone, with a large decrease in the density compared
to the reference model over a broad region below the convective
boundary. The impact on the density in the convective region for
this specic model is partly in agreement with the correction re-
quired for this quantity in the Buldgen et al. (2020) study, with a
positive di

erence found only in the upper part of the convective
envelope (see the fourth trend in Sect. 3.1).
These trends are insensitive to the depth over which the tem-
perature gradient is modied. Increasing the depth increases the
magnitude of the di

erences but has no impact on their sign. We
nd that the maximum variation in the model properties, such as
the speed of sound,

c

ref
, roughly scales with
d
2
ov
. This scal-
ing is linked to the integrated area between the modied temper-
ature gradient curve and the one for the reference (non-modied)
temperature gradient, which roughly decreases linearly with
r
.
This area is proportional to the square of the overshooting depth,
and consequently, the maximum variation in the model proper-
ties is also proportional to
d
2
ov
. The qualitative trends also remain
the same whether overshooting mixing in the reference model
is ignored or included using a step function (with instantaneous
mixing) or an exponential decay for the di

usion coe

cient (e.g.
Freytag et al. 1996).
3.2.2. Self-consistent evolutionar y models
For the tests based on the second method, we ran di

erent sets
of models with di

erent combinations of assumptions, including
or not microscopic di

usion and with or without overshooting
mixing. When overshooting mixing was included in the over-
shooting layer, it was based either on a step function or on an
exponential decay for the di

usion coe

cient. Microscopic dif-
fusion for H and He was implemented according to Thoul et al.
(1994). For these tests, the temperature gradient was modied
according to Eqs. (2)-(5). All models start from the ZAMS and
are evolved until they reach the solar radius and luminosity at the
same age. This was achieved by making small adjustments to the
mixing length,
l
mix
. The models with temperature gradient mod-
ications were compared to the relevant reference model, which
has no modication of the temperature gradient but everything
else is the same (i.e. the same treatment of microscopic di

u-
sion and of overshooting mixing). The evolutionary models with
temperature gradient modications are thus self-consistent. The
main di

erence betw een this approach and the one in the previ-
ous section is that these models accumulate small di

erences in,
for example, central H abundance when compared to their ref-
erence model. These tests produce the same trends in the over-
shooting layer as found for the tests based on the rst method
(Sect. 3.2.1), independently of the treatment of overshooting
mixing and whether microscopic di

usion is included or not.
In the convective zone, all models give a positive di

erence for
the density between the model with a modied temperature gra-
dient and the relevant reference model. For the other quantities
(

erences in the convective zone are very sensitive

with the four trends found by Buldgen et al. (2020) for the four

4. Conclusion
The tests performed in Sect. 3 are based on di

erent methods
(relaxed models versus consistent evolution) that can be used to
construct solar models. Independently of the method used, the
tests show that a local increase in the temperature in the over-
shooting region due to convective penetration provides the quali-
tative e

ects required to improve the speed of sound discrepancy
below the convective boundary. This discrepancy is persistent in

solar models that use low solar metal abundances. This is not
surprising because an increase in the temperature in this spe-
cic region has previously been invoked in the literature to solve
this problem, as mentioned in Sect. 1. However, the details of
the physical process responsible for this local heating have been
lacking, whereas we can now suggest an explanation based on
the B21 results. The trends that we nd for the four structural
quantities (

S

) are robust below the convective bound-
ary and in a large fraction of the radiative core, independently of
the treatment of mixing and di

usion and of the method for con-
structing the models in Sects. 3.2.1 and 3.2.2. Our experiments
additionally show that such a local change in the temperature,
despite being made over a very limited region below the convec-
tive boundary, can also a

ect the density, the entropy, and the
speed of sound in the convective envelope after thermal relax-
ation or evolution on the main sequence. How these quantities
are a

ected in the convective enve lope compared to a reference
model with no local heating depends on the strategy for building
solar models and on the treatment of overshooting mixing. This
mixing is obviously linked to the local heating given that both
result from the same dy namical process. A combined testing of
both e

ects in stellar models could provide more constraints on
the general process of overshooting.
Increasingly, e

orts are now devoted to characterising the
process of convective boundary mixing in stellar models based
on multi-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. More work
is required to obtain reliable determinations of an overshooting
depth and to describe quantitatively the mixing and impact on
the temperature gradient. Understanding the e

ects of rotation
and magnetic elds on overshooting is a signicantly more dif-
cult theoretical and numerical problem to address; however,
e

orts to study these combined non-linear e

ects are ongoing
(Hotta 2017; Korre et al. 2021). Despite the limitations of ex-
isting hydrodynamical simulations, they are already providing
constraints on physical processes usually treated with several
free parameters in 1D stellar evolution models. They can thus
limit the degrees of freedom in a problem as complex as so-
lar modelling. Our primary goal in this work is to highlight the
potential impact of convective penetration on the thermal back-
ground in the overshooting region. The processes studied in B21
that produce a local change in the temperature gradient are also
responsible for the mixing in this region. Because much observa-
tional evidence points towards the need for extra mixing at con-
vective boundaries, for example lithium depletion in solar-like
stars (Bara

e et al. 2017), the size of convective cores (Claret
& Torres 2016), and colour-magnitude diagrams (Castro et al.
2014), solar modellers often include this extra mixing in their
models. But a consistent approach should also require account-
ing for a local change in the temperature gradient. The impact of
this local heating goes in the right direction to improve not only
the discrepancies of solar models below the convective bound-
ary, but also in the convective envelope. This e

ect o

ers an in-
teresting step forward for solving the solar modelling problem.
In this exploratory work, we adopt a simple prescription for the
local heating in the overshooting layer since the main goal is
to highlight its qualitative impact on stellar models. However,
this e

ect should not be considered as another free parameter in
the solar modelling problem. Future multi-dimensional hydro-
dynamical simulations will enable this process, and its treatment
in 1D stellar evolution codes, to be better constrained.
