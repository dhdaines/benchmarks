ABSTRACT
Recent hydrodynamical simulations of convection in a solar-like model suggest that penetrative convective ows at the boundary
of the convective envelope modify the thermal background in the overshooting layer. Based on these results, we implement in one-
dimensional stellar evolution codes a simple prescription to modify the temperature gradient below the convective boundary of a
solar model. This simple prescription qualitatively reproduces the behaviour found in the hydrodynamical simulations, namely a
local heating and smoothing of the temperature gradient below the convective boundary. We show that introducing local heating in
the overshooting layer can reduce the sound-speed discrepancy usually reported between solar models and the structure of the Sun
inferred from helioseismology. It also a

speed of sound. These e

ects could help reduce the discrepancies between solar models and observed constraints based on seismic
inversions of the Ledoux discriminant. Since mixing due to overshooting and local heating are the result of the same convective

1. Introduction
Modelling the internal structure of the Sun is still a challenge.
A recent review by Christensen-Dalsgaard (2021) describes in
detailthelong-standinge

ortstoimprovesolarmodels.Theso-
lar modelling problem refers to the discrepancy between helio-
seismology and solar interior models that adopt low metallici-
tiespredictedbythethree-dimensional(3D)atmospheremodels
of, for example, Asplund et al. (2009) and Ca

au et al. (2011),
in contrast to the high metallicities based on previous litera-
ture compilations by, for example, Anders & Grevesse (1989)
and Grevesse & Noels (1993). Asplund et al. (2021) have re-
cently conrmed with state-of-the-art 3D simulations the rela-
tively low metal abundances for the Sun. Asplund et al. (2021)
consider that their study yields the most reliable solar abun-
dancesavailabletoday,suggestingthatthesolarmodellingprob-
lem is no longer a problem of abundances but rather a problem
ofstellarphysics.Thetreatmentofmixingbelowtheconvective
zone is one of the key processes that could improve solar mod-
els. Several studies indeed reveal that the process of convective
penetration, also called overshooting, at the bottom of the con-
vective envelope could play an important role in improving the
agreement between solar models and helioseismic constraints
(seeforexampleChristensen-Dalsgaardetal.2011;Zhangetal.
2012; Buldgen et al. 2019b). Overshooting in solar models has
most often been treated using di

usive or instantaneous chemi-
calmixing.Atemperaturegradientthatsharplytransitionsfrom
a nearly adiabatic form to a radiative form is usually assumed,
as suggested by the theoretical work of Zahn (1991). Models
with a smoother transition have also been investigated. Based
on the analysis of models with di

erent stratications near the

e
baseoftheconvectivezone,Christensen-Dalsgaardetal.(2011)
found that models that better t the helioseismic data have a
weakly sub-adiabatic temperature gradient in the lower part of
the convective zone and a smooth transition to the radiative gra-
dientintheovershootinglayer.ButChristensen-Dalsgaardetal.
(2011) noted that the required temperature stratication is di

-
cult to reconcile with existing overshooting models and numer-
ical simulations. They concluded that only non-local turbulent
convection models could produce the desired degree of smooth-
ness in the transition (see for example Zhang & Li 2012; Zhang
et al. 2012). But these non-local models remain uncertain, and
their description of overshooting under the conditions found at
the base of the solar convective zone is yet to be validated.
Zhang et al. (2019) explored the impact of overshooting by
introducing a parametrised turbulent kinetic energy ux based
on a model with parameters that are adjusted to improve the
helioseismic properties. They suggest that amelioration can be
obtained specically below the convective envelope. However,

the disagreement between solar models and helioseismic con-
straints. Their results, based on a method that combines multi-
ple structural inversions, suggest that the transition in temper-
ature gradient is improperly reproduced by adopting either an
adiabatic or a radiative temperature gradient in the overshoot-
ing layer. The solution should be somewhere in between these
twoextremes.Christensen-Dalsgaardetal.(2018)alsonotethat
an increase in the temperature at the transition would remove
a remaining small sharp dip in the speed of sound immediately
beneath the convective zone of the model. A major di

Giventhelargenumberofparameterstodealwithinordertoim-
prove solar models and the current lack of strong arguments in
favour of modifying the thermal stratication in the overshoot-
ing layer, there has been no real motivation to deviate from the
traditional picture of a sharp transition as formalised by Zahn
(1991).
The present work is motivated by arguments inspired by hy-
drodynamicalsimulationsofconvectionandconvectivepenetra-
tioninsolar-likemodels.Recenthydrodynamicalsimulationsby

eetal.(2021,hereafterB21)highlighttheprocessoflocal
heatingintheovershootingregionduetopenetratingconvective
motions across the convective boundary. In the following, we
analyse the potential impact of this feature on one-dimensional
(1D) stellar evolution structures in the context of solar models.
The hydrodynamical results of B21 are briey summarised in
Sect. 2, and their impact on 1D models are analysed in Sect. 3
anddiscussedinSect.4.
2. Modication of the thermal background in the
overshooting layer: Results from
two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations
B21 performed two-dimensional (2D) fully compressible time-
implicitsimulationsofconvectionandconvectivepenetrationin
a solar-like model with the MUlti-dimensional Stellar Implicit
Code MUSIC (Viallet et al. 2011, 2016; Go

rey et al. 2017).
The main motivation was to explore the impact of an articial
increaseinthestellarluminosityonthepropertiesofconvection
and convective penetration. This procedure is a common tactic
adopted in hydrodynamical simulations of convection (Rogers
etal.2006;Meakin&Arnett2007;Brunetal.2011;Hotta2017;
Edelmannetal.2019).TheexperimentsofB21highlighttheim-
pact of penetrative downows on the local thermal background
in the overshooting layer. They illustrate how convective down-
ows, when penetrating the region below the convective bound-
aryoftheenvelope,caninducealocalheatingandamodication
of the temperature gradient as a result of compression and shear
in the overshooting layer. This modication of the local back-
ground is connected to a local increase in the radiative ux to
counterbalancethenegativeenthalpyux(orheatux)produced
by penetrating ows. The negative peak of the enthalpy ux
and the positive bump of the radiative ux below the convective
boundary are well-known features described in many numeri-
calworks(Hurlburtetal.1986;Muthsametal.1995;Brummell
et al. 2002; Brun et al. 2011; Hotta 2017; K

2020).Afewworks(Rogersetal.2006;Vialletetal.2013;Korre
et al. 2019; Higl et al. 2021) have also reported a modication
of the local thermal background in the overshooting region, but
withoutprovidingadetaileddescription.ThesimulationsofB21
provideaphysicalexplanationthatlinkstheconvectivepenetra-

sumethatthelocalheatingseeninB21ispresentinstarsbecause

These two features are also commonly observed in other hydro-
dynamical simulations, as mentioned above. An exploration of

in Fig. 1, the temperature gradient becomes less sub-adiabatic
immediately below the convective boundary
1
. The net result is
a smoother transition just below the convective boundary with
a temperature gradient that has an intermediate value between
the radiative temperature gradient and the adiabatic one. In the
next section we analyse the impact of this local heating on 1D
solar structures by adopting a simple prescription that mimics
the behaviour of the temperature gradient suggested by hydro-
dynamicalsimulations.

models
3.1. Helioseismic constraints
Our primary goal in this short paper is to illustrate the potential,
qualitative impact of the local heating produced by overshoot-
ing. We adopted a strategy inspired by the analysis of Buldgen
et al. (2020), who constructed a static structure of the Sun in
agreement with seismic inversions of the Ledoux discriminant

. Starting from a reference evolu-
tionary model, Buldgen et al. (2020) used an inversion pro-
cedure to iteratively reconstruct a solar model. Successive in-
versions of the Ledoux discriminant allowed them to obtain a
model-independentproleforthisquantity.Theirreconstruction
method also gives solar structures that are in excellent agree-
mentwithotherstructuralinversions,namelytheentropy,

the convergence of their reconstruction procedure, they show

catethemodicationsofthereferencemodelthatarerequiredto
converge towards a solar model in agreement with helioseismic
data. We recall here the major trends found by Buldgen et al.
(2020) for the four structural quantities, which are used for our
analysisinSect.3.2.
The rst concerns the Ledoux discriminant. The major dis-
crepancy between the Sun and the reference model occurs just
below the convective boundary, with a large positive bump for
thequantity(

The second concerns the speed of sound. The same positive

Importantly, Buldgen et al. (2020) mention that their recon-
struction procedure gives similar Ledoux discriminant proles
for a wide range of initial reference models. We used these re-
sults to gauge whether the modications of the thermal prole
predicted by B21 can help in qualitatively improving all the
structuralquantitiesusedbyBuldgenetal.(2020).
3.2. Testing one-dimensional solar models
Our main motivation is to show the potential impact of the local
heating described in Sect. 2 on stellar models. We are not aim-
ing in this short work at constructing the best solar model to t
helioseismic constraints. Using stellar evolution codes, we have
adopted two di

erent methods that can be found in the litera-
ture to construct solar models (e.g. Zhang et al. 2012; Vinyoles
et al. 2017). Our rst method relies on the thermal relaxation
of a reference model with solar radius and luminosity that is
modiedtoreproducethetemperaturegradientintheovershoot-
inglayersuggestedbyhydrodynamicalsimulations.Inthiscase,
the chemical abundances are not modied by nuclear reactions,
mixing, or microscopic di

usion during the relaxation process.
For these tests, we used the 1D Lyon stellar evolution code
(Bara

eetal.1998).Werepeatedthisexperimentbasedonther-
mal relaxation with the stellar evolution code MONSTAR (e.g.
Constantino et al. 2014) and obtained the same qualitative re-
sults.
The second method considers models that account for the
modication of the temperature gradient in the overshooting
layer from the zero age main sequence (ZAMS). The models
arethenevolveduntiltheyreachthesolarradiusandluminosity.
With this approach, changes in the chemical abundances from
nuclear reactions, microscopic di

usion, and overshooting mix-
ing are also consistent with any modication of the structure
induced by the forced local heating in the overshooting layer.
These tests were performed with MONSTAR as it includes the
treatmentofmicroscopicdi

usion.
The rst method allows the impact of local heating in
the overshooting layer after thermal relaxation to be isolated.
The second method provides evolutionary models that are self-
consistentsincethee

ectofthemodicationofthetemperature
gradient is accounted for during their evolution on the main se-
quence.

3.2.1. Thermal equilibrium models
The details of the procedure for the rst method are the follow-
ing. We calculate the evolution of a 1

helium mass fraction of 0.28, metallicity
Z

02
;
and a mix-
ing length
l

H
P
. We use a reference model that is in
thermal equilibrium
2
and has the luminosity and radius of the
current Sun. Starting from this reference model, the tempera-
ture gradient is modied over a prescribed depth to mimic the
impact of overshooting according to the hydrodynamical sim-
ulations described in Sect. 2. We adopt the prescription given
by Eqs. (2)-(5) over a distance
d
ov
below the convective bound-
ary. We show the results in Fig. 2 for

ov
=
0.15 and

ov
=
0.20.
Theseovershootingwidthsareingoodagreementwiththemaxi-
maldepthreachedbydownowsbelowtheconvectiveboundary
predicted by the hydrodynamical simulations for the solar-like
model investigated in B21. We note that the stellar model used
inB21isslightlyunder-luminouscomparedtotheSun(seeB21
for details). B21 also mention that one should be cautious when
directlyapplyingtheovershootingdepthspredictedbytheirsim-

tions may have di

states. We varied

ov
between 0.15 and 0.35 and nd that the
results do not change qualitatively. However, the amplitude of
the variations in the model properties depends on
d
ov
(see be-
low). As shown below, this simple prescription implemented in
a stellar evolution code yields a local increase in the tempera-
ture below the convective boundary, similar to that observed in
thehydrodynamicalsimulations.WestressthatEqs.(2)-(5)have

such a modication of the temperature gradient is expected to
improve the agreement with helioseismic constraints and help

remove the sound speed anomaly below the convective bound-
ary (second trend in Sect. 3.1), as suggested by the results of
Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. (2011). But it is also interesting to
note that such a modication yields a slight cooling of the con-
vective zone (see Fig. 2) and thus a negative di

erence for the
entropy (see Fig. 3). A negative di

erence in the convective en-
velope is in agreement with the correction required for the ref-
erence model of Buldgen et al. (2020) to better match the Sun
(see third trend in Sect. 3.1). Regarding the density, the modi-

For the tests based on the second method, we ran di

ofmodelswithdi

erentcombinationsofassumptions,including
or not microscopic di

usion and with or without overshooting
mixing. When overshooting mixing was included in the over-
shooting layer, it was based either on a step function or on an
exponential decay for the di

usion coe

cient. Microscopic dif-
fusion for H and He was implemented according to Thoul et al.
(1994). For these tests, the temperature gradient was modied
according to Eqs. (2)-(5). All models start from the ZAMS and

for example, central H abundance when compared to their ref-

(Sect. 3.2.1), independently of the treatment of overshooting
mixing and whether microscopic di

4. Conclusion
The tests performed in Sect. 3 are based on di

erent methods
(relaxed models versus consistent evolution) that can be used to
construct solar models. Independently of the method used, the
tests show that a local increase in the temperature in the over-

this problem, as mentioned in Sect. 1. However, the details of

structing the models in Sects. 3.2.1 and 3.2.2. Our experiments
additionally show that such a local change in the temperature,
despitebeingmadeoveraverylimitedregionbelowtheconvec-

ect the density, the entropy, and the
speed of sound in the convective envelope after thermal relax-
ation or evolution on the main sequence. How these quantities
are a

ected in the convective envelope compared to a reference
modelwithnolocalheatingdependsonthestrategyforbuilding
solar models and on the treatment of overshooting mixing. This
mixing is obviously linked to the local heating given that both
result from the same dynamical process. A combined testing of
both e

ects in stellar models could provide more constraints on
thegeneralprocessofovershooting.
Increasingly, e

orts are now devoted to characterising the
process of convective boundary mixing in stellar models based
on multi-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. More work
is required to obtain reliable determinations of an overshooting
depth and to describe quantitatively the mixing and impact on
the temperature gradient. Understanding the e

ects of rotation
and magnetic elds on overshooting is a signicantly more dif-
cult theoretical and numerical problem to address; however,
e

orts to study these combined non-linear e

ects are ongoing
(Hotta 2017; Korre et al. 2021). Despite the limitations of ex-
isting hydrodynamical simulations, they are already providing
constraints on physical processes usually treated with several
free parameters in 1D stellar evolution models. They can thus
limit the degrees of freedom in a problem as complex as so-
lar modelling. Our primary goal in this work is to highlight the
potential impact of convective penetration on the thermal back-
groundintheovershootingregion.TheprocessesstudiedinB21
that produce a local change in the temperature gradient are also
responsibleforthemixinginthisregion.Becausemuchobserva-
tional evidence points towards the need for extra mixing at con-
vective boundaries, for example lithium depletion in solar-like
stars (Bara

e et al. 2017), the size of convective cores (Claret
& Torres 2016), and colour-magnitude diagrams (Castro et al.
2014), solar modellers often include this extra mixing in their
models. But a consistent approach should also require account-
ingforalocalchangeinthetemperaturegradient.Theimpactof
this local heating goes in the right direction to improve not only
the discrepancies of solar models below the convective bound-
ary, but also in the convective envelope. This e

ect o

ers an in-
teresting step forward for solving the solar modelling problem.
In this exploratory work, we adopt a simple prescription for the
local heating in the overshooting layer since the main goal is
to highlight its qualitative impact on stellar models. However,
this e

ect should not be considered as another free parameter in
the solar modelling problem. Future multi-dimensional hydro-
dynamicalsimulationswillenablethisprocess,anditstreatment
in1Dstellarevolutioncodes,tobebetterconstrained.
