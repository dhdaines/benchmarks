ABSTRACT
Context.
Pieces of empirical evidence suggest the existence of a period-age relation for long-period variables (LPVs). Yet, this
propertyhashardlybeenstudiedontheoreticalgroundsthusfar.
Aims.
Weaimtoexaminetheperiod-agerelationusingtheresultsfromrecentnonlinearpulsationcalculations.
Methods.
We combined isochrone models with theoretical periods to simulate the distribution of fundamental mode LPV pulsators,
which include Miras, in the period-age plane, and we compared it with observations of LPVs in Galactic and Magellanic Clouds'
clusters.
Results.
In agreement with observations, models predict that the fundamental mode period decreases with increasing age because of
the dominant role of mass in shaping stellar structure and evolution. At a given age, the period distribution shows a non-negligible
width and is skewed toward short periods, except for young C-rich stars. As a result, the period-age relations of O-rich and C-
rich models are predicted to have di

erent slopes. We derived best-t relations describing age and initial mass as a function of the
fundamentalmodeperiodforbothO-andC-richmodels.
Conclusions.
The study conrms the power of the period-age relations to study populations of LPVs of specic types, either O-rich
orC-rich,onstatisticalgrounds.Indoingso,itisrecommendednottolimitastudytoMiras,whichwouldmakeitpronetoselection
biases, but rather to include semi-regular variables that pulsate predominantly in the fundamental mode. The use of the relations to
studyindividualLPVs,ontheotherhand,requiresmorecaregiventhescatterintheperioddistributionpredictedatanygivenage.

1. Introduction
Low- to intermediate-mass stars approach the end of their lives
through the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) evolutionary phase,
during which they exhibit pulsations with timescales up to sev-
eral hundreds of days, and they are hence known as long-period
variables (LPVs). If their
V
-band amplitude exceeds 2.5 mag,
theyareclassiedasMiras,whichhavearatherregularperiodic-
ity and they are believed to pulsate only in the radial fundamen-
tal mode (FM). If their photometric amplitude is smaller, they
are known as semi-regular variables (SRVs), which are thought
to be the progenitors of Miras. The name stems from the lesser
degree of regularity of their light curves, likely due to the fact
thattheycanpulsateinmultiplemodessimultaneously.
ThenotionthatyoungerLPVstendtodisplaylongerperiods
compared to older ones, often referred to as the period-age (PA)
relation,isrootedintheempiricalevidencefromstellarkinemat-
ics in the solar neighborhood. The rst such piece of evidence
is probably due to
 Merrill
 (
1923
), who pointed out that M-type
LPVsincreasinglylagbehindthelocalstandardofrest(i.e.,pos-
sess a higher asymmetric drift) as their period decreases. Later
studies (as summarized by
 Wyatt & Cahn
 1983
) conrmed this
behavior (also using proper motion data, e.g.,
 Wilson & Mer-
rill
 1942
), and showed that the shorter periods are also accom-
panied by a higher velocity dispersion. Furthermore, groups of
LPVswithrelativelyshortperiodsarecharacterizedbyagreater

A number of subsequent works have corroborated the PA
relation on empirical grounds, or have exploited it to interpret
observational results. Relevant examples are studies of LPVs in
globular clusters (e.g.,

2. Methods
2.1. Models
We employed PARSEC-COLIBRI isochrones (
Marigo et al.
2017
) with stellar evolutionary models from
 Pastorelli et al.
(
2019
,
 2020
) for the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch
(TP-AGB) phase, and from PARSEC (
Bressan et al.
 2012
, ver-
sion 1.2S) for the preceding evolution. The adopted set of
isochrones covers the range 0.001 to 0.016 in initial metal-
licity (
Z

), with a 0.001 step, while it spans the age interval

2.2. Data
As a rst set of data, we considered the cluster-LPV pairs used
by
Gradyetal.

19 clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud, hosting a total of 20
potentialLPVmembers,andeightGalacticclusterseachhosting

We expanded this list with data for LPVs in a few populous
clusters, namely the Galactic clusters NGC 362, NGC 2808, 47
Tuc(NGC104),and
!
Cen(NGC5139);theLMCclustersNGC
1978andNGC1846;andtheclusterNGC419intheSmallMag-
ellanic Cloud (SMC). The source lists were taken from
 Lebzel-

,

) and

 (

The aforementioned studies also provide a lot of informa-
tion, possibly including
JHK
photometry, one or more periods,
and a spectral type. In order to expand on the available data,
we crossmatched the selected sample with the Two Micron All-
Sky Survey (2MASS,
 Skrutskie et al.
 2006
), the all-sky data
release of the Wide-eld Infrared Survey Explorer (AllWISE,
Cutri et al.
 2013
), the catalog of variable stars from the All-
Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN

the third phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment
(OGLE-III,

lease from the
Gaia
mission (
Gaia
EDR3,
 Gaia Collaboration
et al.
 2021
), and the catalog of LPV candidates from
Gaia
DR2
(
Mowlavietal.
2018
).
Following
 Grady et al.
 (
2019
), we took ages from
Kharchenkoetal.
(
2016
)and
Baumgardtetal.
(
2013
)forclusters
intheGalaxyandLMC,respectively,therebyensuringthatages
would be homogeneously derived for clusters in both galaxies.
Age uncertainties from
 Baumgardt et al.
 (
2013
), provided for
each cluster, are generally around

the analysis of

As discussed by
 Kamath et al.
 (
2010
), the age of the SMC
cluster NGC 419 is believed to be around 1.4-1.6 Gyr. This is
consistent with the value

Trabucchietal.: Theperiod-agerelationofLPVs
A detailed membership verication is beyond the scope of
this work, and we relied on the checks performed by authors
whose source lists we adopted. It should be kept in mind that
somesourcesmaynotberealclustermembers.
For sources without a spectral type, we used the
Gaia
-
2MASS diagram (
Lebzelter et al.
 2018
,
 2019
) to determine
whethertheyareO-orC-rich.Weusedthenear-infraredperiod-
luminosity diagram to identify the most likely pulsation mode
associated with each period of each observed source. We se-
lectedonlyFMperiodsandrejectedlongsecondaryperiodsand
periods attributed to overtone mode pulsation. The details of
these classication steps are provided in Appendix
 A
. Out of
203 sources from the initial list, we identied 95 LPVs pulsat-
ing in the FM, consisting of 40 C-rich and 55 O-rich sources.
Theyconsistof29Miras,33semi-regularvariables,and33other
sources (most likely LPVs) whose variability type has not been
determined. We note that, with the exception of
Gaia
DR2, the
sources of variability data considered here do not report the un-
certaintyassociatedwithobservedperiods.However,sinceperi-
ods were derived in most cases from well-sampled, high-quality
variability observations, relative period uncertainties are most
likelynegligiblecomparedwiththoseassociatedwithage.

 shows a comparison between model predic-
tions and observations in the

are displayed by a density map showing the expected number
N

of LPVs pulsating in the FM in each period-age bin, nor-
malized to maximum. Model predictions are in good agreement
with data derived from observations (i.e., individual LPVs in
clusters, represented by symbols), and they show that the pe-
riodofLPVspulsatingintheFMdecreaseswithincreasingage.
Crosses mark the average properties of the three groups of C-
rich LPVs from

We also show a linear best-t to the models distribution
(weighted by
N
FM
), which shows a fairly good agreement with
the best-t to observations by
 Grady et al.
 (
2019
, also shown).
However, the best-t line does not fully capture the properties
ofthepredictions,noroftheobservedtrend.Indeed,modelsare

3 Gyr. Observed data are consistent with the predicted
spread, although the agreement cannot be considered as the ob-
servedsampleadoptedisnotcomplete.
Nonetheless, it is relevant that some clusters host multiple
LPVs, which are thus almost coeval, and they do span a wide
period range. Some of these clusters host multiple stellar popu-
lations that are believed to have formed over a time comparable
with the age uncertainties we adopted. This means that longer-
period (more massive) LPVs in these clusters probably lean to-
ward the lower age limit assumed for their host cluster, and the
opposite is true at shorter periods. This tends to strengthen the
agreementbetweenmodelsandobservations.
Our data set samples the intermediate-age range (NGC 419
and NGC 1846) relatively well as well as old ages (
!
Cen, 47
Tuc, NGC 362, and NGC 2808). This provides us with the op-
portunity to study the period distribution at these ages, and for
a more detailed comparison between models and observations.
On the basis of the average age of these two groups of clus-
ters and the associated uncertainty, and taking the discrete age
sampling of the isochrones into account, we considered the age

. Indeed, although at

5 Gyr the observed sample is
very scarce, it appears to be consistent with models predicting a
more densely populated region in the shorter-period half of the
PAdistribution.
The case of C-stars, shown in panel (b) of Fig.

, is di

er-
ent. They only form over a restricted range of initial masses
and ages, so their occurrence in a given stellar population is an
age indicator on its own. Toward the low-mass (old age) side
of the C-star regime, the behavior is similar to the O-rich case
withaconcentrationaroundrelativelyshortperiods.C-richmod-
els tend to have a lower surface temperature and larger radii,
at a given mass, compared to O-rich models, and thus they at-
tain longer periods more easily. This occurs in particular toward
higher masses, so that younger C-rich models are more concen-
trated at longer periods, leading to a steeper PA relation com-
pared with the O-rich case. These predictions agree with ob-
servations on the old side of the period distribution, while the
scarcity of C stars at

4. Discussion
In general agreement with observations, models conrm that
LPVs pulsating predominantly in the FM follow a PA relation,
which exhibits a non-negligible dispersion. Thanks to the newly

shaping stellar structure and evolution. Indeed, stellar mass de-
termines the lifetimes of the main evolutionary stages, and thus
the age of stars in the AGB phase. Pulsation models (

) show that the radius

(and correspond-
ing luminosity) at the onset of dominant FM pulsation (DFMP)
increases with mass, so that the most massive FM-dominated
LPVs are brighter. They also have longer periods, as this in-
creases with radius. In other words, the period, luminosity, and
age near the tip of the AGB are all functions of initial stellar
mass(atleasttoagoodapproximation).

can have at a given age. Yet, the DFMP part of the AGB is long
enough for signicant variations in radius to occur, which result
inthedispersionofthePArelationseeninFig.

.
At a given initial metallicity
Z
i
, the shape of the period dis-
tribution primarily results from the fact that, throughout the TP-
AGB (the stage during which the FM is normally excited), the
envelope expansion accelerates, while the period becomes pro-
gressively less sensitive to changes in radius (see Appendix
 C
).
In particular, the slope of the period-radius relation decreases
sharply at
P
b
=
P
(
R
b
). The FM period distribution is roughly
symmetricaroundthatvalue,butatitsshort-periodside,theFM
isnotdominant.Therefore,whenonlyFM-dominatedLPVsare
considered, as is done here, the observed period distribution ap-
pearsskewedtowardshortperiods.
Thisfeatureisstrengthened whenasetofisochronesis con-
sidered which spans a range of initial metallicities because the
adopted criterion for the onset of DFMP does not depend on
metallicity, but the FM period does as metal-poor LPVs are
warmer and have smaller radii compared with metal-rich ones.
As a consequence, the bulk of the period distribution of metal-
poor LPVs is at periods shorter than
P
b
, so they only contribute
to the global distribution (i.e., at all
Z
i
at a given age) over a

gests that the dependence is weak at most, it is possible for
any discrepancy to be smeared out by the fact that our set of
isochrone implicitly assumes a at star-formation rate with no
age-metallicityrelation,soitisnotanaccuraterepresentationof
anyrealisticstellarenvironment.Inthissense,thePArelationis
environment-dependent,anditisnotnecessarilyuniversal.
A further point of uncertainty stems from the fact that the
prescription we adopted assumes that the FM period only de-
pends upon the mass and radius, and that it is a

ected by a
change in composition only through the e

ect that such a varia-
tionhasontheradius.Whilethisistruetoagoodapproximation,
linear models show a small dependence of periods on metallic-
ity at a xed mass and radius, but the quantitative impact in the
nonlinear case is unknown. We can only estimate, based on the
resultsof
Trabucchietal.

Qualitatively, a realistic age-metallicity relation and the
metallicity dependence of the period and of the onset of DFMP
are all expected to result in a steeper PA relation than the one
we predict, but it is di

cult to assess the relative importance of
these e

ects. In this sense, the composition probably a

ects the
shape of the PA relation more than its dispersion. The latter is
likely a

ected by the composition indirectly through mass loss,
the analysis of which is beyond the scope of this study. How-
ever,wepointoutthatmasslossrepresentsasourceofscatterin
combinationwiththeoccurrenceofthermalpulses,becauseitre-
duces the minimum radius for the onset of DFMP. Thus, during
the luminosity dips associated with thermal pulses, a LPV can
haveaperiodshorterthantheoneithadwhenitrstenteredthe
DFMPregime(seeAppendix
C
).Anadditionalsourceofuncer-
tainty, which we disregarded, is rotation (or other processes that
induce extra mixing in the core) which causes a spread in ages
at a given initial mass (cf.
 Anderson et al.
 2016
, for the case of
classicalCepheids).
Thefairlygoodagreementbetweenmodelsandobservations
encourages the use of LPVs as age indicators, but the scatter of
thePArelationhampersthisapplication.Weattemptedtoreduce
thescatterthroughcorrectionsinvolvingphotometricproperties,
as is customarily done for classical Cepheids with a color term
(e.g.,
Bonoetal.
2005
),butwithunsatisfactoryresults.Acorrec-
tion dependent on the photometric amplitude of variability rep-
resents a promising alternative, but it cannot be pursued at the
moment. Indeed, for computational e

ciency, current pulsation
modelsincludeonlyacrudetreatmentoftheatmosphericlayers
as they do not a

ect pulsation periods. On the other hand, the
atmosphere is crucial in determining the spectral energy distri-
butionanditsvariationthroughoutthepulsationcycle,andhence
the amplitude of variability. At the same time, the observational
sample adopted here is too heterogeneous for a self-consistent
investigation of amplitude, but this kind of study could be made
possible by the upcoming data release 3 of the
Gaia
mission
(
Gaia Collaboration et al.
 2021
) and the future Legacy Survey
of Space and Time (LSST,
 Ivezi
´
c et al.
 2019
) of the Vera Rubin
Observatory.
It is worth noting that our analysis applies to Miras as well
as SRVs, provided that they predominantly pulsate in the FM.
The limitation of PA relation studies to Miras, as has mainly
been done in literature so far, undoubtedly has some advan-
tages: to begin with, the fact that Miras are typically easier to
detect than SRVs, and their light curves are easier to process
as they tend to be more regular. Moreover, Miras represent the
end-pointofAGBevolution,soinprincipletheycorrespondtoa
smallerrangeofstellarparameterscomparedtothefullextentof
the DFMP regime, and they display a smaller range of periods
at a given age (cf.
 Feast & Whitelock
 2000b
). In other words,
theyshouldexhibitarelativelynarrowPArelation(eventhough,
based on the observational data set we adopted, there is no con-
clusive evidence that considering only Miras reduces the scatter
ofthePArelation).
Nonetheless, we caution against this approach as it is prone
to introducing uncontrolled biases, as the traditional distinction
betweenSRVsandMirasisarbitrary(see
Trabucchietal.
2021a
,
and references therein). As such, it disregards the physical pro-
cesses at the origin of the range of amplitudes characterizing
LPVs. In particular, photometric amplitudes are largely deter-
minedbytheformationanddissociationofmoleculesinthestel-
lar atmosphere, and they are likely to be metallicity-dependent.
It is therefore reasonable to assume that metal-poor (old) Mira
analogs might be classied as SRVs, thereby undermining the
potential application of the PA relation if restricted to Miras.
ThisseemstobesupportedbythefactthatthebulkofoldLPVs
in our sample are classied as SRVs. Therefore, studies involv-
ing PA relations of LPVs would advantageously include both
MirasandFM-pulsatingSRVs.
ThechallengeassociatedwithSRVsstemsfromthefactthat
they are often multiperiodic (even when predominantly pulsat-
ing in the FM), a property that complicates the light curve anal-
ysis and period extraction. At the same time, this feature could
potentially improve age determinations as overtone modes are
expectedtodisplayaPArelationaswell.
5. Conclusions
We used the results from recent nonlinear pulsation calculations
andcombinedthemwithstate-of-the-artisochronemodelstoin-
vestigate the PA relation of FM-dominated LPVs, nding good
agreement with the distribution of observed LPVs in star clus-
ters. The theoretical PA relation displays a non-negligible scat-
ter,whoseoriginweidentiedduetothefactthat,despitebeing
very brief, the portion of AGB evolution during which the FM
becomes dominant shows a relatively large range in mass and
radiusatagivenage.
The theoretical distribution of FM periods is roughly sym-
metric, but the FM is not dominant at the shortest periods. As a
result,modelspredictthatthedistributionofdominantFMperi-
ods at a given age is skewed toward short periods, in agreement
with observations. Depending on stellar populations, metallicity
may enhance this feature as metal-poor LPVs, which tend to be
warmerandmorecompact,onlycontributenearshortperiods.
Weprovidethebest-tPArelationseparatelyforO-richand
C-rich FM-pulsating LPVs. The latter LPVs show a steeper PA
relationbecauseoftheirlowersurfacetemperatures,whichallow
themtoreachlongerperiodsmoreeasily.
Our analysis concerns all LPVs predominantly pulsating in
the FM, regardless of whether they are classied as Miras or
SRVs.Wediscouragesuchadistinctioninthatitisarbitraryand
pronetoselectionbiasesthatriskcompromisingtheuseofLPVs
asageindicators.
The main limitation in the use of the PA relation for age de-
terminations of individual LPVs stems from its relatively large
scatter. We suggest that corrective terms, involving the ampli-
tude of variability, might help to reduce this scatter and antici-
pate that upcoming data from ongoing and future surveys dedi-
catedtotime-domainastronomywillbehighlyvaluabletoprobe
thispossibility.Astudyoftheimpactofmetallicityonnonlinear

Appendix A: Classication of observed LPVs
Appendix A.1: Spectral type
We adopted the spectral types provided by
 Lebzelter & Wood
(
2007
)and
Kamathetal.
(
2010
)for52oftheLPVstheystudied
in NGC 1846, NGC 1978, and NGC 419. The only exception
is the star 5-3 in NGC 419, for which we adopted the S-type as
reportedby
LloydEvans
(
1983a
).
We also searched the
SIMBAD
astronomical database
(
Wenger et al.
 2000
) for spectral type information, which we
found for 26 more stars. We used the
Gaia
-2MASS diagram of
Lebzelteretal.
(
2018
)toconrmthechemicaltypeclassication
takenfromliteratureandtocharacterizethesurfacechemistryof
sources of an unknown spectral type (see Fig.

latter,weidentied13C-richstarsand106O-richsources.

The third source is one of the two stars in NGC 1903 from the
list of
 Grady et al.
 (

), which we identied with the 2MASS
source J05171633-6920298. It is likely C-rich according to the
NIRcolor-magnitudediagram.
Finally, the sources V138 in
!
Cen, LW15 in NGC 2808,
and LW4 in NGC 362 lack NIR data. They cannot be placed in
the NIR PL diagram, upon which we relied to assign pulsation
modes to periods, so we excluded them from the sample. The
distribution of O- and C-rich sources in the period-age diagram
isshowninFig.

.
Appendix A.2: Variability
For variability information, we complemented the data from
Lebzelter & Wood and
 Kamath et al.
 (
2010
) with the catalogs
from OGLE-III, ASAS-SN, and
Gaia
DR2. Combining these
datasets,wefoundatleastoneperiodforeachofthe176sources
inoursample.
In order to identify the pulsation mode most likely respon-
sible for periods in a given source, we assumed that the second
overtone mode is associated with sequence A, the rst overtone
mode with sequences B and C
0
, and the fundamental mode with
sequence C (e.g.,
 Trabucchi et al.
 2017
). We excluded long sec-
ondary periods on sequence D as they are not due to stellar pul-
sation (
Soszy
´
nski et al.
 2021
, and references therein), and we
used the pattern of PL sequences in the LMC as a reference to
guidethemodeidentication(cf.
Trabucchietal.
2021a
).
Weperformedthisclassicationseparatelyforperiodscom-
ing from each distinct data set. If two or more periods from dif-
ferent data sets were assigned to the same pulsation mode, we
retained only one of those periods, with priority to the values
from Lebzelter & Wood and
 Kamath et al.
 (
2010
). If the latter
authors do not provide this information, we adopted the period
from OGLE-III if available, and otherwise from ASAS-SN or
from
Gaia
DR2.
For some sources, the periods reported in di

erent catalogs
wereassignedtothesamemodethroughthisprocedure.Inmost
cases, these periods are reasonably similar to each other. Only
in a few cases were they signicantly di

erent, but this did not
alterourconclusions.
When available, the variability type was taken from OGLE-
III or ASAS-SN. We note that we are only interested in whether
a star is classied as a Mira or semi-regular variable. In many
cases, this type is not given or the star is simply considered, for
instance, as an LPV or AGB in
SIMBAD
, in which case we con-
sideredthevariabilitytypeasundetermined.
Appendix B: Fitting relations
WeobtainedanalyticexpressionsforthePArelationsseparately
for O- and C-rich stars, proceeding as follows. For each bin of
log(
˝=
yr)
;
we modeled the period distribution with a Gaussian
kernel density estimator (KDE) and identied the peak of the
distribution. To describe the boundaries of the PA relation, we
adopted, at each age, the values of the period at which the dis-
tribution equals 25% of its maximum. We selected this arbitrary
value upon visual inspection of the PA plane. We modeled the
central trend of the PA relation, as well as its short- and long-
periodedges,withlinearorquadraticfunctionsintheform

Because of the connection between age and initial mass, the
PA relation can be translated into a period-initial mass relation,

We remark that both the PA and the period-initial mass rela-
tions depend on model assumptions, in particular mass loss and
mixing, as well as on the properties of the population of LPVs,
namelythestar-formationhistoryandage-metallicityrelation.

a higher initial mass are more evolved, hence they have a larger
radius and a longer period. The rate at which a period increases
with radius is not xed, but rather decreases with evolution. Ac-

models with a smaller initial mass, the period is still increasing
at a relatively large rate as the envelope expands, while in more
massive models the period has already become less sensitive to
changes in radius. This is reected by a slight inection of the
green curve, which corresponds to the maximum in the period
distribution shown in panel (b) of Fig.
 C.1
. The period distri-
bution of the full TP-AGB range is roughly symmetric around
this maximum, while limiting the selection to DFMP, produces

.
If the luminosity dips following thermal pulses are taken
into account (blue lines), the corresponding envelope contrac-
tion causes the period to decrease, and the cut at
˘
360 days
becomes less sharp. Because of mass loss, the threshold period
P
dom
;

is lowered, so that the shortest period associated with
DFMP does not correspond to the least evolved model (green
circle), but rather to the luminosity dip of a thermal pulse (blue
circle).
Tobeprecise,theearliestoccurrenceofDFMPisontheleft-
mostluminosityspike(redcircle),whosedurationissoshortthat
it is unlikely to be observed. Indeed, the inclusion of luminosity
spikes alters the period distribution at long periods very little.
Luminosity spikes are relevant only for relatively massive and
young TP-AGB stars, and they give rise to the poorly populated
