Abstract
Here, we study the temperature structure of aring and non-
aring coronal loops, using extracted
loops from images taken in six extreme ultraviolet (EUV) cha
nnels recorded by Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA)/ Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). We use dat
a for loops of X2.1-class-aring active
region (AR11283) during 22:10UT till 23:00UT, on 2011, Sept
ember 6; and non-aring active region
(AR12194) during 08:00:00UT till 09:00:00UT on 2014, Octob
er 26. By using spatially-synthesized
Gaussian DEM forward-tting method, we calculate the peak t
emperatures for each strip of the loops.
We apply the Lomb-Scargle method to compute the oscillation
s periods for the temperature series of each
strip. The periods of the temperature oscillations for the 
aring loops are ranged from 7 min to 28.4
min. These temperature oscillations show very close behavi
or to the slow-mode oscillation. We observe
that the temperature oscillations in the aring loops are st
arted at least around 10 minutes before the
transverse oscillations and continue for a long time durati
on even after the transverse oscillations are
ended. The temperature amplitudes are increased at the ari
ng time (during 20 min) in the aring loops.
The periods of the temperatures obtained for the non-aring
loops are ranged from 8.5 min to 30 min,but
their signicances are less (below 0.5) in comparison with t
he aring ones (near to one). Hence the
detected temperature periods for the non-aring loops' str
ips are less probable in comparison with the
aring ones, and maybe they are just uctuations. Based on ou
r conned observations, it seems that the
aringloops' periods show more diversity andtheir tempera
tures have wider ranges of variation than the
non-aring ones. More accurate commentary in this respect r
equires more extensive statistical research
and broader observations.

ntroduction
Analyzing the thermal structure of coronal loops is of consi
derable interest, especially as these
magnetic loops have an essential role in heating the solar ch
romosphere and corona. Such anal-
ysis can help to describe how the process of solar aring is co
rrelated with the loop's thermal
structure.

etically (e.g.,

Fathalian et al.
(

Luna et al.
(

seismology techniques help to elicit the information from o
bservations of oscillatory phenomena
and the results to be interpreted by using theoretical model
s (see for e.g.,
Roberts et al.
(
1984
);
Goossens etal.
(

)). Oscillatorypatternsandprocesseswhichhappenduring

(

Hindman & Jain
(

Russell et al.
(

we know the transverse loops oscillations usually occur in r
esponse to a close lament or are
(
Wills-Davey & Thompson
(
1999
)).
Rapidly decaying long-period oscillations are mostly inte
rpreted as global (or fundamen-
tal mode) standing slow magnetoacoustic waves (reviewed by
Liu & Ofman
(
2014
), and
Wang
(
2011
), also see
Ofman & Wang
(
2002
), and for slow-mode observed in fan-loops see
Pant et al.
(
2017
)). They often occur in hot coronal loops of active regions, a
ssociated with tiny (or micro-)
ares.Increasing evidence has suggested that the harmonic
type of decaying pulsations detected
in intensity plots of solar and stellar aresarepossibly ca
usedby standing slow-mode waves(see
reviews by
Van Doorsselaere et al.
(
2016
), and
McLaughlin et al.
(
2018

and damping mechanisms of slow-mode waves have been studied
theoretically (e.g.,

Investigating and comparing the thermal structures and osc
illations of coronal loops in loops
of aring andnon-aring activeregionscould help usinbett
erunderstanding the loops' material
oscillations and the are impact on them. Several different
methods have been developed to in-
vestigate the thermal structure of the coronal loops and loo
p strands. The thermal stability of the
coronal loops was the subject of research, done by
Habbal & Rosner
(
1979
) (and references cited
therein).
McClymont & Craig
(
1985
) stated that a pressure uctuation must assist asymmetric
coronal temperature perturbation. They concluded that cor
onal loops are impartially stable in
the caseof uniform heating.
VanDoorsselaere etal.
(
2011
)usedspectroscopic line ratiostoobtain
the required temperature (via CHIANTI code) and estimated t
he adiabatic index of the corona.
The dependence of coronal loop temperature on loop length an
d magnetic eld strength is also
a favorite topic. For instance,
Dahlburg et al.
(
2018
) probed the temperature properties of solar
coronal loops over a wide range of lengths and magnetic eld s
trengths via numerical simula-
tions and observed a very high correlation between magnetic
eld strength and a maximum of
the temperature. The effectof temperatureinhomogeneity o
n the periodsand the damping times
of the standing slow-modes in stratiedsolar coronal loops
was studied either (e.g.,
Abedini et al.
(
2012
)).
Fathalian
(
2019
)estimated the loop temperatureusing the intensity ratios
and the AIAre-
sponse functions in different wavelengths. Different emis
sion measure (DEM) computations and
methods have been developed to estimate the temperature in t
he corona, which led to various
discussions.
Schmelz et al.
(
2010
) analyzed a coronal loop, which was observed on 2010 August
3, by AIA. They took some differential emission measure (DEM
) curves, claiming a multithermal
rather than an isothermal DEM distribution (for the cross-s
ectional temperature of the loop). Af-
ter that,
Aschwanden & Boerner
(
2011
) criticized the method of background subtraction which
Schmelz et al. had applied. They claimed that the background
subtraction method caused their
inferred result of a multithermal loop.
Aschwanden & Boerner
(
2011
) analyzed a set of hundred
loops and understood that 66% of the loops could be tted with
a narrowband single-Gaussian
DEM model. In this regard, some attention was paid to the inst
rumental limitations and abil-
ity of AIA and
Guennou et al.
(
2012a
,
b
) discussed on the accuracy of the differential emission
measure diagnostics of solar plasmas in respect of the AIA in
strument of SDO. The abovemen-
tioned controversy of whether the cross-eld temperatures
of coronal loops are multithermal or
isothermal, continued by
Schmelz et al.
(
2013
) (similar to
Schmelz et al.
(
2011
)). They analyzed
twelveloops tounderstand the cross-eld temperaturedist
ributions of themand revealthe loops'
substructure. Based on their achievements, the warmer loop
s entail broader DEMs. Thereafter,
Schmelz et al.
(
2014
)found indications of a relationship betweenthe DEM weight
ed-temperature
and the cross-eld DEM width for coronal loops. They argued t
hat cooler loops tend to have
narrower DEM widths. This could imply that fewer strands are
seen emitting in the later cool-
ing phase, which they claim could potentially resolve the ab
ovementioned controversy. In this
subject,
Aschwanden et al.
(
2015
) (as well as 2013 (
Aschwanden
,
2013
)) developed a method to
extract the loop temperature which is based on Gaussian t fo
r Differential Emission Measure,
named spatially-synthesized Gaussian DEM forward-tting
method (DEM hereafter).
This paper aims to analyze and compare thermal oscillations
of coronal loops in aring and
non-aring activeregions, 11283and12194,respectively.

We investigate the thermal structure and treatment of loops
in a aring region to see if it follows
the transverse oscillations of the loops, and we examine the
thermal uctuations at the are time.
For this purpose, we select a high energy are x2.1 which the t
ransverse oscillations of two loops
ofithavebeenanalyzedby
Jainetal.
(
2015
). Theyanalyzedintensity variationsinthewavelength
171 in two coronal loops of this region and detected obvious t
ransverse oscillation with periods
of roughly 2 minutes and decay times of 5 minutes for these loo
ps at the are time. To see
the specic thermal properties of the aring loops, as a blin
d test, we select a non-aring active
region, extract its loops and analyze their thermal treatme
nt. Then we compare the temperature
treatment of the loops at the aring region with the loops of t
he non-aring region to see the
differences.
The temperature analysis done here uses EUV images from the A
IA onboard the SDO. AIA
has ten different wavelength channels, three in white light
and UV, and the other seven in EUV
channels. Between these seven, the 304 lter, which is mostl
y sensitive to chromospheric temper-
atures(inorderof
T

K),not the corona, isnot takeninto account (Aschwandenet a
l. 2015).
Therefore, we consider the images of the events in the six wav
elengths (94, 131, 171, 193, 211, 335
). These are covering the coronal temperature range from

The two below data sets are nally selected to study thermal v
ariations and coronal loops
oscillations in aring or non-aring active regions. A few d
istinct loops are visible in the regions.
Finally, these loops are chosen:

happening around the loops with the specication we are look
ing for. So this selected LOS
X-are, which occurs near the loops is of rare cases. We consi
der EUV images of NOAA
AR 11283, in the time period of 22:10UT till 23:00UT of 2011 Se
ptember 6 with the cadence
of 12 sec. This period of time is selected since no other are i
s happening during it. A
few distinct loops are visible and follow-able here during t
his period. Loop shapes in our
active region change permanently; therefore, it is difcul
t or impossible to follow a loop
over a very long time. Hence, it is not useful to extend the tim
e interval of this region
to the time before the are. The transverse oscillations of t
wo loops in this region were
analyzed before by
Jain et al.
(
2015
). We mark these loops by A and B in Figure
1
b. They
detected fundamental mode oscillation with periods of roug
hly 2 minutes and decay time
of 5 minutes for these loops. We are curious to see the loops' t
hermal oscillations (if any)
or thermal uctuations in this condition. Figure

These loops are relatively motionless and do not show any tra
nsversal oscillation (see the
region's movie in the link). We select the loops in such a way t
hat they do not have any
crossing over the neighbor loops (in our perspective) durin
g this time. In gure

The data set are primarily downloaded at level 1 with a pixel r

We extract the selected loop segment pixels, for each loop, a
nd calculate the normal vectors
to each point of the loop's direction. Then by using these dat
a, we straighten each loop in a
considered box with the thickness of 15 to 40 pixels (macro-p
ixels, depending on the available
empty area around each loop and the distance to the neighbor l
oop). The area around the
loop is needed for calculations of background subtraction.
The selected loop segment is cut in

du/webapp.html, and https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/
all wavelengths and at the same considered box from the image
s set. These loop images are
necessary entrances for our thermal analysis process. Then
the loop is divided into different
strips and its best division in terms of pixel intervals is co
nsidered. To do thermal analysis, we
use the spatially-synthesized Gaussian DEM forward-ttin
g method founded by
Aschwanden
et al.
(
2015
).
The images in the above six wavelength lters are considered
to calculate the temperature in
each strip of the loop. The DEM function is considered a singl
e-Gaussian function relative to the
temperature determined by the forward tting method. To obt
ain the temperature for each loop,
we divided the loop into narrow strips, and then the intensit
y ux was averaged over each strip.
The number of each strip is displayed with the index i. One of t
he usual methods to subtract
the background from observed data is tting a single-Gaussi
an cospatial function with a linear
function on the ux prole. The DEM for each strip is consider
ed to be single-Gaussian DEM
in terms of the logarithm of the temperature, which has three
free parameters (

Our data sample is uneven because of omitting some damaged im
ages in between. There-
fore to analyze the temperature oscillations, we use the Lom
b-Scargle method. This method is
developed to use the technique periodogram, in the case wher
e the observation times are un-
evenly spaced (
Scargle
,
1982
). The Lomb-Scargle periodogram method is useful in cases wh
ere
the periodicity of data treatment is not immediately appare
nt. This method allows efcient com-
putation of a Fourier-like power spectrum estimator from un
evenly-sampled data, resulting in
an intuitive means of determining the period of oscillation
(
VanderPlas
,
2018
). Therefore we use
Lomb-Scargle Periodogram to evaluate and estimate the efc
ient periods of temperature oscilla-
tions in our loops. We select the rst period related to the hi
ghest power frequency, which is
obtained by this method.We considered the achieved periods
with the highest signicances and
amplitudes. The most signicant (highest) periods observe
d in temperature (minute) for aring
and non-aring loops are listed in Tables 1 and 2, respective
ly. To estimate the signicance of
the periods, we computed the probability values (p-values)
. In the Lomb-Scargle method, the
signicance returned here is the false alarm probability of
the null hypothesis, i.e., as the data
is composed of independent Gaussian random variables. Acco
rdingly, low probability values
(p-value less than 0.05) indicate a high degree of signican
ce in the associated periodic signal.

i. Temperature Analysis of Flaring Active Region Loops
Thenceforth the temperature time-series of different stri
ps of the selected loops are calculated
using the method described in section 3. In the following gu
res, the vertical axis shows the
logarithm of the temperature and the horizontal axis shows t
he time duration. To be comparable
byeyes, all the forthcoming gures(which showthe loops tem
peratureoscillations) havebeenco-

2,and6strips, respectively. Each
strip'slength is equal to4pixels(macro-pixel), forall lo
ops in thispaper. For brevity, afewstrips'
temperature oscillations are presented here. Figure
3
displays the time-series of temperature
oscillations for the rst 3 strips of Loop A, and rst 2 strips
of loops B1. We calculated the
errors for each point (temperature)but removed in the prese
ntation to avoid overcrowding of the
gures. As we observe in Figures
3
and
4
), the temperature oscillations are started and increase
around 22:12 before the are peak time (22:20) and are mostly
continuing after the are ended
(22:24). These temperature oscillations follow the transv
erse loop oscillations observed by
Jain
et al.
(
2015
). As Jain et al. reported, LoopA and B have a transverse oscil
lation with periods
of roughly 2 minutes and decay times of 5 minutes, starting at
22:18 around the are peak time
(23:20)anddecayingaftertheareended(22:24). Soasweob
serve,thetemperatureoscillationsin
these aring loops happenbeforethe start of their transver
seoscillations andarecontinuing even
in the time interval after the transverse oscillations deca
y. Although the temperature oscillations
do not decay as rapid as the transverse oscillations do, and c
onversely, the loop temperature
increases at the end of the oscillating mode (see Fig.
4
, the temperature map of the loop A, for
instance)
We calculate the temperature oscillations periods, using L
omb-Scargle method. We consider
the thermal oscillations periods with the highest signica
nces. As this method shows, the most
powerful period in the range of data time-series (listed in T
able
1
) are from 7 to 28.4 minutes
observed in the strips of the marked loops of this aring regi
on. These loops of aring region
also show some short periods in temperature oscillations wh
ich some are less than 10 minutes
(listed in Table
1
). These short periods are more frequently observed in the lo
ops of the aring
active region. Such short periods are very scarce for the loo
ps of the non-aring active region
(compare Tables
1
and
2
).
The rst column in Table
1
is the number of every strip along the loop. The second column
is
the period of the most powerful frequency observed for the lo
op strips, calculated by the Lomb-
Scargle method. The third column shows the maximum of log
(
T
)
minus its minimum in each
strip. The columns of Table
2
are exactly the same as Table
1
; the only difference is that Table
2
is
for the non-aring loops.
The loop A, has the length of 42.3 (Mm) which is the length of th
e selected part of the loop
marked in Figure
1

)-Min(log
T
)) for the strips of loop A
is 1.21. Mean of the temperature (log) of this loop over time i

of the temperature for this loop are, 1.10, and 6.28

strips, with the length of 15.61 (Mm), has the mean temperatu
re (log) of 6.21

of (Max(log

ded into

)) of 1.48, 0.88, respectively.
We observe that despite the temperature oscillations, the 
aring loops show a temperature
rise at the end of the considered time interval (gure
3
). As their temperature maps also show,
the oscillations follow with a relatively sensible rise in t
he nal temperatureof the loop segments
(Figures
4
). Although in the case of the transverse oscillations, the l
oops oscillate as the are
occurs and then the oscillations decay and stop, in the case o
f temperature oscillations, the tem-
peratures of the various strips of the loops oscillate and at
the end of the are occurrence, they
get to a relatively higher value of temperature in average.
Figure
4
shows the temperature maps of the aring loops A, B1, B2, C1, a
nd C2, respectively
as a time series. In each plot, the vertical axis is the distan
ce along the loop segment in Mm, and
the horizontal axis shows time. The color bar (in the left) sh
ows the temperature range. Each
separated grid part on the map is standing for one strip. Figu
re
4
shows that the temperature
for most of the strips increased, bypassing a few oscillatio
ns. Before the end of the time duration,
some strips become hotter (yellow ones) and some cooler (blu
e ones). The loop B1 is colder at
the early times of the duration and becomes hotter at the midd
le and end times with a swing
to lower temperatures again (see Fig.
4
). There are some temperature uctuations at the middle
times (the red and green stripes) while at the end the strips t
emperatures are smoother with less
uctuations. The temperature map of the loop segment B2 (Fig
.
4
) shows that at the beginning of
the time duration, the rst stripsof the loop arehotter, and
the last ones arecolder, but at the end
times this pattern is reversed in this loop segment. In loop s
egment C1 (Fig.
4
), the temperature
uctuations are mainly observed to start after the end of the
are (22:24), and at the end time
(23:00) the temperature is much higher than the beginning. T
he temperature is increasing after
the are time (22:24) for the loop C2 either (see Fig.
4
). This happens with some oscillations in
the strips' temperatures. So as gure
4
shows, the temperature increases with some uctuation
in most of the aring loops' strips after the are time. Accor
ding to these temperature maps,
the temperature uctuations in the aring loops are increas
ing at the aring time and around 20
minutes after that.
We expect the aring loops to cool down as a result of heat cond
uction and radiative cooling.
Hence this relative temperature increase should be scrutin
ized. As we probed, this temperature
riseisalsofollowedinintensitytime-series. Astheinten
sitytime-seriesshow, therelatedintensity
in the Loop A of the aring AR increases at the end of the time du
ration. To be assured, the
authors also checked the wavelength of Fe
XVIII
which has a peak formation temperature of
7



K
(
Ugarte-Urra& Warren
(
2014
)). By using the method developedby
Warrenet al.
(
2012
)
the contribution of the Fe
XVIII
emission line can be isolated from the AIA 94 , to analyze the
evolution of hot plasma in the loops. We do it to omit the conta
mination from the cooler plasma
(mostly around 1MK) which also contributes to this AIA chann
el
Boerner et al.
(
2012
). This is
done by subtracting the contaminating warm (i.e., around 1M
K) component to the bandpass.
This warm contribution is calculated from a weighted combin
ation of the emission from the AIA
171 and 193 channels dominated by Fe
X
and Fe
XII
emission, respectively. This intensity
analysis is done directly and it has not gone through any othe
r process like the thermal analysis.
For this purpose, we applied the formulation (1) used by
Li et al.
(
2015
). Plots in Figure
5
show
the intensity map, and the mean intensity variation of the wa
velength Fe
XVIII
, for Loop A of
the aring region, respectively. As these plots show, this i
ntensity is also higher at the end of
the time duration in respect of the are time. It seems to us th
at the expected cooling has not
occurred in these aring loops yet, even after the are occur
rence in the probed duration due to
some plausible reasons. We consider that the mentioned simu
ltaneous CME (see section
II
) which
this are is associated with could cause this increase in tem
perature. We can be sure that the
source of this CME is AR 11283 (
Romano et al.
(
2015
)). This CME is in our are region, hence
the loops receive energy even after the are occurrence and i
t is probably the reason why the
expected cooling does not occur.
The thermal oscillations periods obtained the Lomb-Scargl
e method, do not have the same
signicance in all strips of the loops, but for most strips of
the aring loops, the signicances are
very near to one. To be assured about these oscillations, we p
robed the intensity time-series for
each strip of the loops and we observed that this loop's inten
sities shows intensity oscillations
too (i.e., alongside the loop). The most probable dominant p
eriods observed in intensity, for
wavelength of 171 is 18.22, and 16.7 min for strips of F-Loop A
, 16.7, and 18.22 min for strips of
F-Loop B1, 16.70, and 12.52 for F-Loop B2, and 16.7 for F-Loop
C1 and F-Loop C2. These periods
arein the same order of the observed thermal oscillation per
iods. The intensity in this time series
has not passed any thermal process but still shows oscillati
on periods close to thermal ones. So
we think these results conrm the observation of thermal osc
illations.
ii. Temperature Analysis of non-Flaring Active Region Loop
s
The temperature time-series for different strips of the sel
ected loops of the non-aring active
region 12194 are calculated using the Lomb-Scargle method.
In the following gures (Fig.
6
),
the vertical axis shows the logarithm of the temperature and
the horizontal axis shows the time
duration. Figure
6
displays the time-series of temperature variations for the
rst two strips of
the non-aring Loops A, and B. These gures are all co-scaled
in the range of 5.7 to 6.9 for the
logarithm of temperature (like the aring loops range). The
most powerful periods, observed in
most of these non-aring loops' strips (listed in Table
2
) are from 8.5 min. to 30 min. Comparing
the periods of the loops in the aring region (Table
1
) with the non-aring one (Table
2
), we see
that the temperature periods of the aring loops have lower v
alues on average and have more
diversity than the non-aring ones. As Tables
1
and
2
show, the mean temperatures of nonf-
loops are lower in comparison with the f-loops, a fact we also
expected from common sense.
The parameter (Max(log
T
)-Min(log
T
)) in nonf-loops' strips is less than that for the aring loop
s'
strips.
Nonf-loop A, divided into 11 strips, has the length of 19.91 (
Mm) which is the length of the
selected part of the loop marked in Figure
2
b. The mean of (Max(log
T
)-Min(log
T
)) for the strips
of nonf-loop A is0.81. Meanof the temperature(log) of this l
oop segment overtime is5.93

0.10.
Nonf-Loop B, dividedinto6 strips, hasthe length of 11.11(M
m),and the meantemperature(log),
and the mean of (Max(log
T
)-Min(log
T
)) for this loop are, 5.99

0.13and 0.62 respectively. Nonf-
loop C, which has 5 strips, with the length of 10.13 (Mm), has t
he mean temperature (log) of
5.82

0.12, and the mean (Max(log
T
)-Min(log
T
)) of 0.56.
The rst highest period observed for the temperature oscill
ations of these non-aring loops'
strips is reported in Table
2
. As we observe the temperature periods in these non-aring l
oops
are mostly longer than those of the aring loops (compare the
values listed in Table
1
and Table
2
).
Therefore the temperature oscillations of these loops are a
little slower than the aring ones.
Figure
7
shows the temperature maps of the non-aring loops A, B, and C
, respectively as a
time series. Ineach plot, the verticalaxisis the distance a
long the loop in Mm, and the horizontal
axis is the time. The color bar in the left shows the colors con
sidered for the temperature range.
Each separated colored part in the map is one strip. These col
or maps are plotted totally at the
same color range of the loops of the aring region either.
As gure
7
shows, the strips' temperature of these non-aring loops ha
ve fewer temperature
uctuations and are smoother in comparison with the aring o
nes (Fig.
4
). Furthermore, that
much increase in the temperatures of the strips, which was ob
vious in the loops of the aring
region toward the end times, is not observed here. The temper
atures are also totally lower in the
nonf-loops in comparison with the aring loops. Conversely
, it seems that different strips of the
non-aring loops have relatively more similar temperature
uctuations.
As gure
8
shows, the peaks of the observed temperature periods for the
loops' strips of the
aring active region (blue ones), and non-aring active reg
ion (red ones), are around 18 minutes,
and 30 minutes, respectively. The temperature periods' div
ersity is higher in the loops' strips of
the aring active region, and shorter temperature periods (
less than 10 minutes, nearer to the
transverse oscillations periods) are observed in the case o
f the aring loops' strips in comparison
with the non-aring ones. And gure

We reported the temperature oscillations of coronal loops o
f a aring active region. We selected
the aring activeregion11283toinvestigate thethermal st
ructureandtreatmentofitsloops. This
regionincludesahighenergyarex2.1andthetransverseos
cillationsoftwoloopsofithavebeen
analyzed before by
Jain et al.
(
2015
). They analyzed intensity variations in the wavelength 171
in two coronal loops of this region and detected obvious tran
sverse oscillation with periods of
roughly 2 minutes and decay times of 5 minutes for these loops
(loops A and B in Figure.
1
b)
at the are time. We were curious to know if the temperature va
riations follow the transverse
oscillations of the loops, or there is any relation or correl
ation between them. We also wanted to
investigate the thermal uctuations at the are time. As a bl
ind test to see the specic thermal
propertiesofthearingloops, weselectedaLOSnon-aring
activeregion(12194),extractedthree
segments of its loops and analyzed their thermal treatment.
Then we compared the temperature
treatment of the loops at the aring region with the loops of t
he non-aring region to see the
differences. We wereeagertoobserve the probable discrepa
nciesbetweenaring and non-aring
loops in this respect.
Here we used dataof three loops of the aring active region (A
R11283)around the time of the
Flare X2.1, from 22:10UT till 23:00UT on 2011 September 6, pl
us three loops of the non-aring
active region (AR12194), from 08:00:00UT till 09:00:00UT o
f 2014 October 26 (marked in gures
1
and
2
). To calculate the time series of the loop temperature value
s, we rst extracted the loop
pixels in each image and then displayed the loop straightly f
or all the images in the time series
of different wavelengths. To do thermal analysis, we used th
e spatially-synthesized Gaussian
DEM forward-tting method founded by
Aschwanden et al.
(
2015
). We calculated the peak
temperatures for each strip of the loops. Then we applied the
Lomb-Scargle method to analyze
temperature oscillations of the time-series for each strip
of the loops.
We observed temperature oscillations which are following t
he transverse loop oscillations
observed by
Jain et al.
(
2015
) for the aring loops. Furthermore, the temperature oscill
ations in
these aring loops happen before the transverse oscillatio
ns start and continue even in the time
duration after the transverse oscillations decay. As obser
ved, the temperature oscillations do not
decay as rapidly as the transverse oscillations do. Convers
ely, the strips' temperatures increase
at the end of the oscillating mode and a rather sensible rise i
s observed in the nal temperatures
of the f-loops' segments. The ranges of the obtained periods
are from 7 min. to 28.4 min. for the
aring loops, and from 8.5 min. to 30 min. for the non-aring l
oops. With the onset of X-are in
the F-loopA, which has a distinct transverse oscillation in
the aring time with period of roughly
2 minutes and decay time of 5 minutes, a temperature oscillat
ion is observed with periods of
roughly 10 to 28.5 minutes in different segments of this loop
. And as the transverse oscillation
decays in this interval, no special denite decay is observe
d in its temperature oscillations.
The temperature periods of the aring loops are rather short
er than the temperature periods
of the non-aring loops. The loopsof the aring regionshow s
ome short temperatureoscillations
periods in which some are less than 10 minutes (Table
1
). These kind of short periods are more
frequently observed for the loops of the aring active regio
n and in the case of the non-aring
ones, are very scarce. We observed that the periods of the ar
ing loops have more diversity
than those of the non-aring ones. Based on our conned obser
vations, the non-aring loops'
periods are longer and their temperatures' values are total
ly lower. So our research showed that
thermal structures of the aring loops differ from the non-
aring ones in the ways described
above. Astemperaturemapsshow, the temperatureuctuatio
ns areincreasing at the aring time
and around 20 min. after, in the aring loops. This happens wi
th some oscillations in strips'
temperature. Conversely, it seems that different strips of
the non-aring loops have relatively
more similar temperature uctuations. The temperatures ar
e either higher in average in the ar-
ing loops' segments as expected. The signicances of the per
iods, obtained by the Lomb-Scargle
method, are calculated for each strip of each loop and the res
ults show that these signicances
for the loops' strips of the aring region are high and close t
o one, while for the loops' strips of
the non-aring region are less than 0.5. Hence the detected p
eriods in the aring loops' strips
have high signicances (near to one) and are oscillations. W
hereas the detected periods in the
non-aring loops' strips have less signicances in compari
son with the aring ones, and maybe
they are just uctuations.
Using this method for the coronal loops showed that the oscil
lation modes obtained for the
temperatures of the aring loops are very close to those of th
e spatial slow-mode oscillations of
the coronal loops. So the origin of temperature oscillation
is probably slow-mode waves. These
kind of oscillations often occur in hot coronal loops (log
(
T
)
>
6) of active regions especially the
ones associated with small (or micro-) ares (
Wang et al.
(
2021
)). The loops of our aring active
region are also hot loops with the mean temperature above thi
s range. They also show intensity
oscillations. Hence we think the above evidence conrms the
slow-mode oscillations for aring
loops. The temperature of the non-aring loops are lower (lo
g
(
T
)
<
6) and as discussed above,
webelievethattheobservedoscillation-like periodsinno
n-aring loopsshould bemoreprobably
related to the high amplitude uctuations.
Comparing the loops of the aring and non-aring regions, we
observed that the amplitudes
of the uctuations show a discrepancy. Mean of the parameter
(Max(log
T
)-Min(log
T
)) in the
FloopA, , FloopB1, FLoopB2, FloopC1, and FloopC2, are 1.21,
1.10, 0.81, 1.48, and 0.88, respec-
tively. And for non-aring region, mean of (Max(log
T
)-Min(log
T
)), are 0.81, 0.62, and 0.56, for
nonoopA, B, and C respectively. Therefore the values of the
quantity mean of (Max(log
T
)-
Min(log
T
)) for these non-aring loops show a difference from the ari
ng ones and are lower.
Loops of the non-aring active region 12194 have a relativel
y uniform temperature at the
beginning of the time interval, which rises slightly at its e
nd. As the Solar Monitor reports in the
neighborhood of this region, the aring active region 12192
exists of which between its multiple
ares, there is a
c
4.6 class are occurring at 9:44UT. Therefore, it could be a p
ossible suggestion
that the abovementioned slight temperature rise in the loop
s of AR 12194 (in the time interval
8:00 to 9:00) originated from the inuence of an increase in t
he energy at the pre-are conditions
exist in the AR 12192.
Hence as our study shows, the temperature of coronal loops of
aring AR changes in an
oscillatory manner. Compared with these non-aring loops,
the aring loops show higher tem-
peratures on average and higher oscillation periods with hi
gher peaks and deeper valleys. More
accurate commentary in this respect requires more extensiv
e statistical research and broader ob-
servations.
