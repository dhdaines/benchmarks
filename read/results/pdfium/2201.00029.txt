Abstract
As is common with the collection of astronomical data, signals are frequently dominated 
by noise. However, when performing FTs of light curves, re-binning data can improve the signalto-noise ratio (SNR) at lower frequencies. Using data collected from the Kepler space telescope, 
we sequentially re-binned data three times to investigate the SNR improvement of lower frequency 
(< 17 µHz) variability in white dwarf KIC 8626021. We found that the SNR at approximately 5.8
µHz greatly improved through this process, and we postulate that this frequency is linked to the 
rotation of KIC 8626021.
Introduction
First detected in 1862, white dwarfs long posed a mystery for early observers. When the 
companion to Sirius was detected, apparent contradictions concerning the mass, luminosities, and 
densities baffled astronomers. Lacking full understanding of atomic structures and the energy 
states of electrons, these early researchers believed white dwarfs too dense to exist. However, new 
discoveries at the turn of the 20th century explained the existence of these stars, and between the 
world wars white dwarfs were increasingly studied and modeled (Holberg, 2009).
As stars age, those that lack the mass to become neutron stars and black holes become 
white dwarf stars, representing 98% of the stars in our galaxy (Winget & Kepler, 2008). They are 
composed of a core of carbon and oxygen ions that slowly cools over billions of years, and the 
light emanating from these stars is a result of thermal energy. White dwarf stars are no longer 
supported against the force of gravity by fusion, so the stars collapse into an electron-degenerate 
state where the electrons in the carbon and oxygen atoms occupy the lowest energy levels. As two 
electrons cannot occupy the same quantum state, Pauli repulsion keeps white dwarfs from 
collapsing entirely.
For many years, accurate detection of light variability in white dwarfs was difficult due to 
a lack of adequate instruments. However, the launch of the Kepler space telescope in 2009 made 
capturing the light of distant stars much more efficient and effective (Basri et al., 2010). Kepler 
was initially developed with the intention of surveying our region of the Milky Way galaxy in 
order to find potentially habitable planets. The purpose of the mission was to identify key traits for 
such planets by determining the number of planets in habitable zones, the sizes and shapes of orbits, 
and the characteristics of the stars being orbited. Over the lifespan of its first mission, Kepler 
observed approximately 1.5 x 105 stars (Johnson, 2018), affording scientists excellent 
opportunities to research stellar variability. Due to the loss of a second reaction wheel in 2013, 
NASA developed the K2 mission, a way to prolong Kepler’s assistance to astronomy and 
astrophysics.
Utilizing Kepler’s ability to maintain three-dimensional control, NASA proceeded to use 
the telescope to collect photometry data of certain sections of our galaxy, although the number of 
targets was significantly reduced. In addition, the K2 mission was designed to be communityoriented, with the scientific community having an influence on the fields observed and serving as 
the analysts of the vast amounts of data being received (Howell et al., 2014). Although Kepler was 
deactivated in 2018, the data used in this paper came from observations during 2010 and 2012 of 
white dwarf KIC 8626021 and was obtained from the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Operations 
Center (KASOC).

FIG. 1: Pictured top is the light curve constructed for Q7, below is the light curve for Q13. Q7 
lasted from September 24 – December 13, 2010, and Q13 was from March 29 – June 23, 2012.
Both graphs were constructed by plotting corrected flux magnitude (flux corrected for 
instrumental artifacts) versus time in Excel, and gaps in the data were filled in by interpolating 
between points. Q7 had forty-three interpolated points, and Q13 had sixty-six.

FIG. 2: The graphs show the initial FTs of Q7, and then the FTs of the three successive re-bins of 
the light curve data. The significant frequencies of 5.886 µHz and 5.889 µHz are circled. The 
disappearance of the frequency in the last FT is most likely a byproduct of the method, and the 
spurious frequency of 5.464 µHz in the last FT most probably represents an artifact of the rebinning process.
