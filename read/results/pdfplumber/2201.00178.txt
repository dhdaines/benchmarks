ABSTRACT
The technique of normal-mode coupling is a powerful tool with which to seismically image non-
axisymmetricphenomenaintheSun. HereweapplymodecouplingintheCartesianapproximationto
probe steady, near-surface flows in the Sun. Using Doppler cubes obtained from the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we perform inversions on mode-coupling
measurements to show that the resulting divergence and radial vorticity maps at supergranular length
scales (∼30 Mm) near the surface compare extremely well with those obtained using the Local Corre-
lation Tracking method. We find that the Pearson correlation coefficient is ≥ 0.9 for divergence flows,
while ≥ 0.8 is obtained for the radial vorticity.

1. INTRODUCTION
Helioseismology is the study of the Sun’s internal structure and its properties, by means of interpreting its effect
on solar oscillations (see Christensen-Dalsgaard 2002, for a review). These are resonant normal modes of the Sun,
behaving as standing waves in a cavity bounded by the solar surface and a depth that depends on the wavenumber
of the oscillation. As these waves penetrate the interior, they register information of the properties and dynamics of
the solar interior and return to the surface, where they are observed. The internal structure of the Sun can then be
retrieved through meticulous inversions of these seismic measurements.
Several important flow systems on the Sun have been inferred using various global and local helioseismic methods.
Of those, the most notable global helioseismic results include inferences on the solar differential rotation, through
global mode frequency splitting (Thompson et al. 1996; Schou et al. 1998), and the resolving the neutrino problem
(Bahcall & Pinsonneault 1992). Notable local helioseismic results include imaging of the meridional flow (Giles et al.
1997; Gizon et al. 2020) through time-distance helioseismology (Duvall et al. 1993), and farside imaging of active
regions (Braun & Lindsey 2001) and their near side emergence (Birch et al. 2016), through helioseismic holography
(Lindsey & Braun 2000). The recent discovery of various inertial waves (Gizon et al. 2021), including the equatorial
Rossby wave (L¨optien et al. 2018), has been achieved through local helioseismic ring-diagram analysis (Hill 1988) and
the non-helioseismic local correlation tracking (LCT, November & Simon 1988) of granulation.
In recent years, the use of global mode-coupling helioseismology (Woodard 1989; Lavely & Ritzwoller 1992) has
received attention, with many studies seeking to validate and demonstrate the importance of such a technique for
investigating numerous solar phenomena. While the derivation of the mode-coupling technique is mathematically
challenging, the data analysis is simple and utilizes all the information registered by the mode. Thus far, global
mode-couplinghas been validated throughobservationsof the meridionalflow(Vorontsov 2011; Woodard etal. 2013),
differentialrotation(Schad&Roth2020;Kashyapetal.2021),global-scaleconvection(Woodard2014,2016;Hanasoge
et al.2020; Mani & Hanasoge2021) and Rossby modes(Hanasoge & Mandal2019; Mandal &Hanasoge 2020; Mandal
et al. 2021). Local mode-coupling analysis in the Cartesian approximation, formulated by Woodard (2006), was
validated by Hanson et al. (2021) (hereafter H21) by examining the power-spectrum of supergranular waves and
comparing with previous time-distance studies (Langfellner et al. 2018).

eigenfunctions would then encode all the perturbations that are absent in the model. The forward problem then
reduces to relating observed seismic measurements to the perturbations that we want to infer. The surface wavefield
cross-correlation is the primary measurement in the mode-coupling analysis and can be directly related to the weights
(Woodard 2016). As mode coupling is a Fourier domain technique, wavefields are cross-correlated at different spatial
and temporal frequencies, leaving us with measurements sensitive to different quantities of interest.
In this study, we extend the spectral analysis of H21 and develop the method to produce near-surface flow maps
at supergranulation length scales. A part of the formalism that was used to derive the forward model in H21 is
reworked,primarilytoimagesteadyflows. Measurementsarethenconstructed,andinversionstoinferdivergenceflow
and radial vorticity are described. We also demonstrate signal associated with supergranular flow in a radial-order
coupling (p
2
-p
2
), which was not shown in H21. This helps in localizing the measurement sensitivity to the surface.
We compare our results with flows obtained using the Local Correlation Tracking method on solar granules.
1.1. Forward problem
In favor of algebraic brevity, we only show crucial steps here and refer the interested reader to Appendix A for a
complete derivation of the forward problem. Working in the plane-parallel atmosphere (see also Woodard 2006), we
denote the horizontal unit vectors e
x
and e
y
in our local Cartesian domain as pointing towards west and north on the
solar surface, respectively, and e
z
points outwards. This approximation is valid when observing patches of the surface
that are small when compared to the solar radius. When imaging steady, near-surface flows in the neighbourhood
of the supergranular scale (∼ 30 Mm), we expect the measured spectral cross-correlation signal to peak around the
horizontal wavenumber qR
(cid:12)
≈ 120 (Rincon & Rieutord 2018), where q = |q| = |(q
x
,q
y
)| is the vector horizontal
wavenumber of the flow. Accordingly, the goal is to relate measurements (linearly, to facilitate inversion) to the flow
perturbationdescribedinahorizontalFourierdomain. Supergranularvelocitiesaresubsonic(300-400m/s,seeRincon

where P = Pσ(x) and T = Tσ(x) are poloidal and toroidal scalar functions, varying with position x and temporal
frequency σ. ∇ is the 3D gradient operator. While mode-coupling can easily be extended to study time-varying
perturbations (see Woodard 2016; Mani & Hanasoge 2020; Hanasoge et al. 2020; Mandal & Hanasoge 2020, for
example), here we only consider the frequency bin σ = 0, denoting the temporally averaged flow over the period
of analysis. We therefore suppress σ from all terms this point forward, remembering that temporal dynamics of
perturbations may also be studied using the same model outlined in the following paragraphs. Simplifying eq 1 using

The flow coefficients P

, represented by the discrete indices q and j, become ideal candidates for inversions,
where the flow for each wavenumber q can be inverted for independently; parallelization in computation can thus be
exploited to expedite inversions. Note that P

Summing over ±ω guarantees that the parity B

(see Appendix A for derivation) is obeyed, thereby
ensuring that the flow field on the right-hand-side of eq 6 is a real physical quantity in the spatio-temporal domain.

Substituting parity and symmetry relations for all terms in the above results in eq 6. As B
k,q
is constructed by a
least-squares fitting, it is noteworthy that summing over −ω will also lead to improvement in its signal-to-noise as a
by-product.
1.3. Noise model
In the addition to the sensitivity kernels, a systematic background noise model is required to infer the flows from
the observed B-coefficients. For estimating the contribution from realization noise to the measurements, we make the
followingassumptions(Gizon&Birch2004): thattheexcitationofthewavefieldismodelledasamultivariateGaussian

random forcing function (see Duvall & Harvey 1986). Modes are thus generated with random phases and amplitudes
and with finite lifetimes. This stochasticity leads to realization noise in repeated measurements of mode parameters

2. DATA ANALYSIS
In order to examine near surface flows we build a time-series cube of Doppler images that are obtained from the
Helioseismic Magnetic Imager aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (HMI/SDO, Scherrer et al. 2012). Each image
is Postel projected, with a spatial resolution of approximately 0.48Mm, sperated in time by 45 seconds, and is tracked
at the (Snodgrass 1984) rotation rate. Here, we select a patch that is 194.4×194.4 Mm2 in size, tracked for 24 hours
and crosses the disk-center in the middle of observation time on the 14 Novemeber 2017 (Carrington rotation number
2197,Carringtonlongitude90◦). ThisDopplercubeisconsideredasthephysicalwavefieldφ(x,y;t). TheFourier-space

Fourier transform of the Dopplercube.
The duration of the observed region is long enough to provide sufficient frequency bins with which to sum over in
Eq 6, while short enough that supergranules do not substantially evolve (lifetime is purported to be 1.6 days; Rincon
& Rieutord 2018) over this period. Our observation region is close to the disk center to also avoid any contamination
from center-to-limb systematics (Zhao et al. 2012; Langfellner et al. 2015).
Maximum signal can be extracted from the weighted summation of the cross correlations (eq 5) when the spectral
profiles of the two modes [n,k] and [n(cid:48),k(cid:48)] closely align in ω space. This implies that their mode frequencies should be
sufficiently close (|ω
nk
−ω
n(cid:48)k(cid:48)
| ≤ δ, the separation parameter). Since Lorentzians decay rapidly, the summation over
±ω is significant only over a few linewidths ((cid:15), the summation parameter; see eq 7). We have empirically found and
tabulated δ in Table 1 for the radial order couplings n-n(cid:48) ∈ f-f, p

(the signal strength depends only
weakly on (cid:15); we set it to 3 line widths).
Figure 1 shows that for any two adjacent ridges (adjacent n and n(cid:48)), mode frequencies ω

and ω
n(cid:48)k
become spaced
farther apart with increasing wavenumber kR
(cid:12)
. It is also known that mode linewidth Γ grows with radial orders for
a given kR
(cid:12)
. Moreover, holding the spatial and temporal sampling rates constant, the spatial size and duration of
observation set the total number of modes within a range of kR
(cid:12)
(and ω/2π) that can be clearly observed, thereby
affecting the quality of the seismic measurements. Owing to these factors, to maximize signal-to-noise (by visually

3. INVERSION
The final step to producing near-surface flow maps in Cartesian mode-coupling is to invert the measurements
B
k,q
from the linear relation in eq 6. We describe inversion using regularized-least-squares (RLS) method here and
leave Subtractive Optimally Localized Averages (SOLA, Pijpers & Thompson 1994) for Appendix B. The methods
complement each other (see Sekii 1997), where RLS tries to minimize the misfit between data and model, whereas
SOLA gives better localization. For total number of modes M, RLS scales as MxJ where J is the number of basis
functions f
j
(z) (J (cid:28) M; see eq 3 and section 3.1), whereas SOLA scales as M2 (see Appendix B). For M > 5000,
computation starts to quickly become expensive for SOLA.
Mode eigenfunctions peak near the surface, with higher radial orders possessing smaller peaks in the interior. While
f-f coupling alone has enough sensitivity to probe perturbations at supergranular scales close to surface, signal is

with
the regularization parameter λ which this results in a trade-off between misfit reduction (first term) and solution
norm minimization (second term). Under-regularizing can lead to a solution U that is dominated by errors in the
data and on the other hand, over-regularizing may smooth or damp the solution more than necessary. Including this
regularization makes the problem better conditioned and is now defined as
U=(K (cid:124) Λ−1K+λI)−1K (cid:124) Λ−1B, (13)
where I is the identity matrix for L

by plotting ||U||

for different values of λ (see right panel of Figure 2), is usually chosen as the
regularization parameter. After successfully inverting for U, we reconstruct the flow using eq 3. Results for poloidal

are shown in Figure 3.
4. LCT
Toimproveconfidenceintheimagednear-surfaceflowsthroughmode-coupling,wecomparethemwithflowsobtained
from Local Correlation Tracking method (LCT; November & Simon 1988). LCT provides surface-flow maps by
examining the advection of convective granules (1.2 Mm, qR
(cid:12)
≈ 3500; Hathaway et al. 2015) by underlying larger-
scale flow systems. Since granules are used as tracers, which are much smaller in size than supergranules (≈35 Mm),
LCT is an effective method (see Rieutord et al. 2001) to produce surface horizontal flow maps of supergranulation.
Time series of intensity images from HMI, with the same properties of the Dopplercubes described in section 2
(tracking rate, date, location, size and duration of observed patch, spatial and temporal sampling rate), are ob-
tained and Postel projected. The horizontal flows are deduced by tracking the proper motions of granules between
consecutive intensity images, which we denote as I
1
,I
2
. The LCT method selects a patch in two images each
(I
1

e(x−xij)2/2sigma2,I
2
= I
2
e(x−xij)2/2sigma2) that observe the same granule at the grid point x
ij
= (x
i
,y
j
).
A Gaussian of width sigma allows to isolate a small region surrounding the grid point of interest as the distance
moved by granules are usually in sub-pixel regime. The convention for the direction of x is the same as described in
section 1.1. The two patches I
1
,I
2
are then cross correlated for different values of position shifts ∆x,
C
ij
(∆x,∆y)=
(cid:90)
dxI∗

(−x)I
2
(∆x−x). (14)
The shift ∆x = (∆x,∆y) that maximizes the cross-correlation C
ij
is taken to be the proper motion of the granule.
Provided that the time difference ∆t, here 45 seconds, between the images is less than the lifetime of granules (< 10
min), the velocities are given by v
x
= ∆x/∆t and v
y
= ∆y/∆t. This exercise is repeated for all grid points in the
images I
1
,I
2
and for each consecutive pair of images in the cube.
In practice, we use the Fourier LCT algorithm (FLCT, Fisher & Welsch 2008) for computing v
x
and v
y
. FLCT
requires the input sigma, which we set to 4 pix, that captures the extent of localization desired, and depends on the

We follow similar steps to those taken in Langfellner et al. (2015) for comparison of flow maps with LCT. The
essential step for comparison at different length scales is to bandpass filter the Fourier-space flow around the qR
(cid:12)
of
interest (see Figure 4), and subsequently convert it to real space.
We seek to show comparisons (see Figures 5, 6, and 7) for qR
(cid:12)
= 100, 150, 200 and 250. To sufficiently delineate
flows at these length scales, we apply a Gaussian filter (see Figure 4) to flows obtained from eqns 16 and 17. The
Gaussian is centered at the desired wavenumber with a half-width of 25. We then perform a 2D Fourier transform to
obtain a real-space steady-flow map.

power-spectrum is then filtered with a bandpass centered around qR
(cid:12)
=150 (middle panel). The resulting spectra is shown in
the right panel. The units of |div|2 are in s−2. For illustration, we show the action of the filter on the power-spectrum |div|2
since it is a real quantity, but recall that it is the Fourier-space flow div (a complex quantity) on which we apply the filter.
For LCT, we first apply a Gaussian smoothing to v

and v
y
to average over small-scale features; the extent of
smoothing depends on the length scale qR

to be compared with mode-coupling. div and curl are then simply

We then perform a 2D Fourier transform on eqns 18 and 19, apply the same Gaussian filters as for mode-coupling,
and transform back to real space.
Condensing all of the above, the following sequence of operations to compare flows at desired length scales are
performed for mode-coupling (M-C) and for LCT -

6. RESULTS
Table 2 summarizes the results of the comparison between flows obtained from mode-coupling and LCT. Figure 5,
where we have used all the couplings to perform inversions, shows a 97% correlation between divergence flows from
the two methods near supergranular scale (qR
(cid:12)
≈ 100). Near-surface flows are imaged most faithfully when all the
couplings are used. Since vortical flows are imaged at a region near the equator, it is possible that the source of
vorticity is something other than Coriolis force. Nevertheless, there is also a very good agreement (87%) between
the vortical flows as inferred from the two methods, despite being an order of magnitude weaker than the divergence
flows (this is consistent with the results of Hathaway et al. 2015; Langfellner et al. 2015; Rincon et al. 2017). Due to

flows at different scales (qR
(cid:12)

inferred flow moves further away from that of supergranules (Figure 7), the demand on signal-to-noise also increases.
An adequate number of modes (and coupling strength between higher radial-orders) thus becomes a necessity to
comment substantively on the flows at these scales.

For both LCT and mode-coupling divergence and vorticity maps, numerous factors, arising from the associated
numerous data processing steps, can influence the final inference of flow amplitudes, making it difficult to put forward
a precise statement on them. H21 reported a 60% greater amplitude for p

over f-f coupling (Figure 3 reflects a
similar conclusion), another element to consider when combining different radial orders. The choice of regularization
(see right panel of Figure 2) has the potential to affect the amplitudes of the inverted flows to some degree. Flow
amplitudes also vary with depth, implying that different radial orders and LCT will measure different flow averages.
This variability emerges as a natural consequence of any helioseismic inversion procedure necessitating the use of a
radial grid along which kernels and flows tend to be described.
Thus, theamplitudesofthemode-couplingflows(andthecorrelationcoefficient)dependuponthefollowingfactors:
• Coupling(s) used,
• Regularization parameter in the inversion,
• Smoothing applied to LCT flows (indirectly; see below paragraph),
• The depth at which flows are inferred.
Here, we report in Table 2 only the maximum correlation found from among the points in the radial grid close
to the surface (within ±0.5 Mm from z=0). For a desired comparison length scale qR
(cid:12)
, we first fix the coupling(s)
and the regularization parameter to be used in the inversion. We then separately compute filtered divergence and

from travel-time measurements with those of LCT, while acknowledging that LCT underestimates magnitudes (see
Verma et al. 2013; L¨optien et al. 2016). Even for the case of supergranulation divergence maps obtained through
ring-diagram helioseismology, Greer et al. (2016) only report normalized amplitudes.
In this work, we have developed inversions to show that the Cartesian approximation of mode-coupling can be used
with great confidence to investigate flows near the surface. Careful inversions of mode-coupling measurements, built
usingasufficientlylargemodesetthatpenetratesintothedeeperlayersoftheconvectionzone,canalsoenableprobing
of the depth structure and time-evolution of supergranules, part of future work. With enough modes to improve
signal-to-noise through larger observation sizes, we suggest that Cartesian mode-coupling can find local helioseismic
applications to investigate other depth- and time-varying features such as giant cell flows (see Hathaway et al. 2013;
Hanson et al. 2020), emerging active regions, meridional flows and Rossby waves.

Note that Eq. A8 through A10 are modified from H21 to ensure parity and that flow maps are real.
The three equations A8 through A10, along with the symmetry relation for kernels, and summation over ±ω, serve
to establish the parity Bσ

α

, it is assumed that a set of sensitivity kernels K
k,q
(z) for the mode q can be summed up coherently to give an
’averaging kernel’ thatis localized atthe depth z
o
. Conventionally, a Gaussiancenteredat z
o
and awidth ∆is chosen
which the averaging kernel should resemble after performing inversion.
B.1. Kernels in the integral form
Since the kernels in eq A6 are manifest as coefficients on a basis f
j
(z), we first derive kernels that can be expressed
as a function of depth z (see Figure 8). It is convenient to derive in matrix form. Thus, with the following definitions:
P ≡ P
q
(z), p ≡ P
qj
, F ≡ f
j
(z), B ≡ B
k,q
C ≡ C
qj,k
and K ≡ K
k,q
(z), we write (assume only poloidal flow for
simplicity, the same derivations hold true for toroidal flow as well)
P =Fp (B11)
The size of P is thus the same as the length of the radial grid z.
Now, pre-multiply by FT and integrate over z on both sides (drop the integral notation for compactness),
FTP =(FTF)p
p=(FTF)−1FTP (B12)
Now, substituting eq B12 into the forward problem eq 6,
B =Cp
